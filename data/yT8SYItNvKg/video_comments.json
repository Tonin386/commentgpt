I gotta learn more!  Neon will be a waaaayyy off in the future but this song is Beautiful!, Beautiful!  I wish I could see you live in Charlotte but my wife and I will be celebrating our 28th wedding anniversary and funds are tight due to the economy and work, so, I will learn this song and sing it with her...acoustically.

I have a couple tattoos that I connected with so much so I see them all the time and they are still in most meaningful to me\nhelped me the mos I was with a very Mentally emotionally abusive person for 17 years I thought that was how was going to be forever it took some time But I finally left and got divorced took more time to heal and love myself again and I know John Mayer does not know how he\u2019s helped me so much to have the courage and the wanting to be happy again and he still does his music is beautiful and connects with so many people, and usually good people the bad people  not so much, like I had that were bad in my life do not like John much so they lost out I won and this song last train is probably the most beautiful intro acoustically that I\u2019ve ever heard except one exception if you ever watched John Mayer on his own on YouTube it was a concert and the intro to hummingbird is on my loop and I\u2019ve listen to it and slept to it a lot of times and I have it looped just for that intro because it\u2019s that beautiful I use it to calm down when I have anxiety I listen to mostly acoustically when I\u2019m feeling anxiety and when I\u2019m feeling good I get to listen to the best guitar player in my life probably in a lot of generations and I get happy and I dance and I sing and I love his blues I love it hard and I love it soft, his music will always be part of my life  I know what I\u2019m watching and he is the best I\u2019ve ever seen and or heard and I feel so lucky that he stuck with it and as his fans we\u2019ve all watched him come so far from the beginning I love as much as I love what he plays now. You know how he always says thank you after every song in every concert I\u2019ve always wanted to tell him NO, thank you for helping me get through life \u2764\u2764\ud83c\udf89",

Listen to the intro to 'where the light is' - it's exactly the same line he plays there and the whole song 'last train' is build around that line. So it took at least 13 years for this idea to develop and finally get produced as a song. And it certainly has gotten a masterpiece. Some ideas take a long time to ripen! https://youtu.be/SCDdjnHsiB8",
