Jika mereka melakukan hal itu maka darah dan harta mereka akan dilindungi kecuali dengan hak Islam dan perhitungan mereka ada pada Allah Subhanahu wata'ala.\n\n(Riwayat Bukhori dan Muslim)\nCatatan :\n\nHadits ini secara praktis dialami zaman kekhalifahan Abu Bakar As-Shiddiq, sejumlah rakyatnya ada yang kembali kafir. Maka Abu Bakar bertekad memerangi mereka termasuk di antaranya mereka yang menolak membayar zakat. Maka Umar bin Khottob menegurnya seraya berkata : \u201c Bagaimana kamu akan memerangi mereka yang mengucapkan Laa Ilaaha Illallah sedangkan Rasulullah telah bersabda : Aku diperintahkan\u2026..(seperti hadits diatas)\u201d . Maka berkatalah Abu Bakar : \u201cSesungguhnya zakat adalah haknya harta\u201d, hingga akhirnya Umar menerima dan ikut bersamanya memerangi mereka.\n\nPelajaran yang terdapat dalam hadits / \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0648\u0627\u0626\u062f \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u062f\u064a\u062b :\n\nMaklumat peperangan kepada mereka yang musyrik hingga mereka selamat.\nDiperbolehkannya membunuh orang yang mengingkari shalat dan memerangi mereka yang menolak membayar zakat.\nTidak diperbolehkan berlaku sewenang-wenang terhadap harta dan darah kaum muslimin.\nDiperbolehkannya hukuman mati bagi setiap muslim jika dia melakukan perbuatan yang menuntut dijatuhkannya hukuman seperti itu seperti : Berzina bagi orang yang sudah menikah (muhshan), membunuh orang lain dengan sengaja dan meninggalkan agamanya dan jamaahnya .\nDalam hadits ini terdapat jawaban bagi kalangan murji\u2019ah yang mengira bahwa iman tidak membutuhkan amal perbuatan.\nTidak mengkafirkan pelaku bid\u2019ah yang menyatakan keesaan Allah dan menjalankan syari\u2019atnya.\nDidalamnya terdapat dalil bahwa diterimanya amal yang zhahir dan menghukumi berdasarkan sesuatu yang zhahir \n\nhttps://twitter.com/fanniemionekim?t=kQJXNB7erM9jRX7KPzFsdg&s=09",

The End.",
