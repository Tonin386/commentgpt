        "text": "This song is responsible for my life today. \nwhen i was bullied massively in school, and it got so bad to the point where I was about to attempt suicide, and I planned it that evening. i still remember my mom was switching channels on the TV, and she stops at this song, where that last glorious part of the song from 4:13 started playing on the TV \"who are we, we run, the world\" and omfg the dance, the vocals, the music, something about that part ignited something in me, i didnt know why. i couldn't stop the goosebumps and sat in my room just in silence the whole day, forgetting what i even planned to do.\nthe next day i went back to school more motivated than ever; the bullying obviously won't stop, that's not the point. i found more courage in me to not let it get to me and focus on better things. \nheard so many rumors about her and who she \"really is\", don't know about all that, but this song feels divine, atleast to a 14 year old girl years ago who was saved from ending her life then. \nyou will forever be the queen, Queen B \u2764",

It made her the artist she is today. An artist who has no boundaries in music. She goes against the grain and it works FOR HER. The 4 album was a true gumbo of sounds (as she stated) and is a R&B classic that hasn't got the recognition she deserved. Clive Davis was right in giving her the title \"First Lady of Music\". She touched nearly every genre of music and it sounds organic.",

        "text": "Napoleon Bonaparte[a] (born Napoleone Buonaparte; 15 August 1769 \u2013 5 May 1821), later known by his regnal name Napoleon I,[b] was a Corsican-born French military commander and political leader who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and led successful campaigns during the Revolutionary Wars. He was the de facto leader of the French Republic as First Consul from 1799 to 1804, then Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814 and again in 1815. Napoleon's political and cultural legacy endures to this day, as a highly celebrated and controversial leader. He initiated many liberal reforms that have persisted in society, and is considered one of the greatest military commanders in history. His campaigns are still studied at military academies worldwide. Between three and six million civilians and soldiers died in what became known as the Napoleonic Wars.[2][3]\r\n\r\nNapoleon was born on the island of Corsica, not long after its annexation by France, to a native family descending from minor Italian nobility.[4][5] He supported the French Revolution in 1789 while serving in the French army, and tried to spread its ideals to his native Corsica. He rose rapidly in the Army after he saved the governing French Directory by firing on royalist insurgents. In 1796, he began a military campaign against the Austrians and their Italian allies, scoring decisive victories and becoming a national hero. Two years later, he led a military expedition to Egypt that served as a springboard to political power. He engineered a coup in November 1799 and became First Consul of the Republic.\r\n\r\nDifferences with the United Kingdom meant France faced the War of the Third Coalition by 1805. Napoleon shattered this coalition with victories in the Ulm campaign, and at the Battle of Austerlitz, which led to the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1806, the Fourth Coalition took up arms against him. Napoleon defeated Prussia at the battles of Jena and Auerstedt, marched the Grande Arm\u00e9e into Eastern Europe, and defeated the Russians in June 1807 at Friedland, forcing the defeated nations of the Fourth Coalition to accept the Treaties of Tilsit. Two years later, the Austrians challenged the French again during the War of the Fifth Coalition, but Napoleon solidified his grip over Europe after triumphing at the Battle of Wagram.\r\n\r\nHoping to extend the Continental System, his embargo against Britain, Napoleon invaded the Iberian Peninsula and declared his brother Joseph the King of Spain in 1808. The Spanish and the Portuguese revolted in the Peninsular War aided by a British army, culminating in defeat for Napoleon's marshals. Napoleon launched an invasion of Russia in the summer of 1812. The resulting campaign witnessed the catastrophic retreat of Napoleon's Grande Arm\u00e9e. In 1813, Prussia and Austria joined Russian forces in a Sixth Coalition against France, resulting in a large coalition army defeating Napoleon at the Battle of Leipzig. The coalition invaded France and captured Paris, forcing Napoleon to abdicate in April 1814. He was exiled to the island of Elba, between Corsica and Italy. In France, the Bourbons were restored to power.\r\n\r\nNapoleon escaped in February 1815 and took control of France.[6] The Allies responded by forming a Seventh Coalition, which defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815. The British exiled him to the remote island of Saint Helena in the Atlantic, where he died in 1821 at the age of 51.\r\n\r\nNapoleon had an extensive impact on the modern world, bringing liberal reforms to the lands he conquered, especially the regions of the Low Countries, Switzerland and parts of modern Italy and Germany. He implemented many liberal policies in France and Western Europe",

She is the vector full of energy, technically very well supported, of all the market fashions and fables of Capitalism in crisis. It is therefore there to entertain, divert while being profitable. Which she does very well. Beyonc\u00e9 is pure showbiz, it's not Roger Waters or the Frenchman Jacques Brel. It is, if you like it, fireworks and if you are indifferent, a piece of junk that shines, in any case something that will leave nothing in history. It is therefore useless to criticize it.",

Whenever I think of this song I remember her from the video (she was not put upfront for those moves by accident, you can see she moves in a very unique way, for those types of moves). You can notice specifically from 3:56 to 4:02 also, where she is at center screen. She even outshines Beyonce in that part of the video, which is something people rarely let happen, I mean, having a background dancer outperform the main artist so blatantly.",
