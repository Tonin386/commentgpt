        "text": "The most barbaric disease that affects 220,000,000 females that could be described as drop dead gorgeous super beautiful heroines that save the world called Endometriosis has no cure. It just has barbaric treatments which are useful in only 25% of Endo warriors causing pain that has been described as being like giving birth 4 to 5 times weekly for an Endo warriors entire high school,college and working lives when it could have been removed early in life when it is entirely in the reproductive system before it spreads throughout the body to places no surgical equipment, medicines nor any Endo specialist can get to, constantly reqrowing.\r\n\r\nWhere by the time an Endo warrior enters menopause when estrogen stop fertilizes Endo, almost all have had at least 10 to up to 20 either excision (removal) or ablation (burning off the top) surgeries at a cost per failed attempt of $10,000 with insurance for those fortunate to cover to $50,000 without it costing each Endo warrior up to an accumulated 3 years off work for recoveries and an additional two years in lost time at work, leading to a near impossibility of ever achieving 1,250 fmla hours and almost always getting fired asking for ADA which simply isn\u2019t accomodatable and an average of 25 to 30 jobs.\r\n\r\nI am calling on a national movement to create a simple 15 minute naval injection of a fluid that would reach to every organ surface and even penetrate organs to kill ademyosis and leave a lifetime protective coating at a cost of less than $100 and the same recovery time to resume daily activities (mostly work) as quickly as covid vaccines that were invented for several variants at no cost and distributed to virtually the entire world in months.\r\n\r\nThe same intensity given to covid that individuals could have prevented should be equaled to Endo warriors who got the horror by being born female and with abnormal levels of estrogen that fertilizes the endo to them.That while blesses the world with overpowering beauty, prettiness, radiance , picturesque professionalism, overwhelming intelligence, talent, skills,dedication all used for unfathomable morality,ethics, wholesomeness and virtue and seemingly every positive external and internal characteristic.\r\n\r\nIt takes about 12 years brushed off by doctors who know nothing about Endometriosis getting false diagnoisis\u2019 and needless tests. Starting with the first complaint to parents and teachers in middle school or even elementary school about pelvic pains, especially inserting tampons, excessive painful urination and defecation, abnormal amounts of period length and discharge. Where uneducated parents and teachers view their young girls and just being hysterical, trying to get attention or wondering, what are they trying to jet out of this month like she does every month. Leading to discipline and yelling at, instead of finding out what is wrong with her and getting her an ultra sound to detect ovarian cysts which are the primary indicator of Endometriosis. For which if detected and treated in the first few years of periods can be successfully removed with excision surgery in its entirety when only in the reproductive system resulting in a normal pain free life with but a child hood trauma and not by the time when they are even 15 when it has spread so much that no surgical equipment nor any Endo specialist can get to, leading to a high school, college, working life until menopause of excruciating daily pain that almost all Endo mothers claim is worse than child birth. By the time an Endo warrior begins college the pain that was once only a stomach pain where the all the endo was, has grown everywhere cementing itself on every organ along with whole body pain. Each so called \u201cGold Standard\u201d results in less pain relief, longer recovery times and thus more time without pay.\r\n\r\nWith good parents and teachers who won\u2019t just tell their crying students to just get back to class and stop faking it, which is what virtually all that is done in schools, who observe the obvious that a young girl is a fantastic student and person, ready for school and maybe a job an hour before needed with a life full of extra circular activities Yet ever three weeks or so for about a week she is still in bed at 7:10 has to painfully urinate seemingly all the time and torture like removing and inserting tampons and a bladder so filled she can\u2019t make it to the end of class without bleeding  through clothes. A young girl won\u2019t suffer. If the parents do medical research instead of discipline for being hysterical to find the reason for their daughter\u2019s suffering , she would never endured in the first place.\r\n\r\nWhen estrogen production ends , the scar tissue from the burning off of ablation surgery or the digging into tissue over and over for almost all leads to pain for life. The Trojan horse promoted by doctors being hysterectomies or birth control only eliminates endo reqrowth in 15% to 20% percent of those barbarically conned like was done in the horribly inaccurate scenes in Grey\u2019s Anatomy season 18 episode 10 where a endo warrior just goes into Grey Sloan the doctors immediately assume Endo and that afternoon do a lap and prescribe birth control and pain meds-all in a single visit. Where for every single Endo warrior the cruel voyage to a lap is at least 12 years of barbaric women\u2019s medical gaslighting.\r\n\r\nAnd as Endo Warrior Victoria Williams and my inspiration claims, once a woman comes forward seeking ADA at work, they are instead given less hours, less responsibility and thus less pay leading to what Meghhin cries out in her video,,,\u201dI only have so much money and I spend it all on doctors that aren\u2019t helping.\u201d Or her best line to her doctor \u201cI am paying you thousands and thousands of dollars and you can\u2019t even tell me I have Endo and not just Allen Masters Syndrome. I pay them thousands of dollars and they have one job and they say they don\u2019t want to risk looking at al the places, but someone who is a specialist should have the skill and expertise to go to difficult places.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd while non Endo people have runs, dog walks and workouts before a long day of pleasurable work then going out with friends to some fun place,an Endo warrior with no dog or cat because they can\u2019t afford the deposit or risk unpayable vet bills, starts the day with a hot cbd bubble bath, then loading up on prescription pain pills and the con job birth control pills which just screw up hormones, just to make it to lunch where they take more pain pills and heating pads and just hope to make it home safe and not have to stop in an ER or rest in someone\u2019s driveway to make it home to get their medical marijuana to help them survive another day having already used up most of their sick days for the week, terrified how many pills it will take tomorrow, desperately struggling for days off to sleep and cry while their coworkers are hiking, going on weekend trips, reading and watching Hallmark movies while Endo warriors read and watch medical journals about how the hysterectomy one of the dozens of gaslighting doctors told her would be a cure.\r\n\r\nAnd the hardships of painful sex or any type of pelvic contact ruins most male relationships that result in many break ups a year as soon as sex is desired, leading them to seek the unconditional love of cats (my most inspirational Endo cats, Jinx, Belle and Bo and dogs(a yorkie called Cooper).\r\n\r\nEndo is so common yet only 20% of primary care physicians know even one symptom and there are but 100 excision specialists in the country and only 200 in the world due to the extra years of training it takes without getting paid instead of providing other people medical care. For if there was a cure as simple as covid, Endo warriors could have Hope For The Future\u2026that\r\n\r\nWE\u2019LL FIND TOMORROW..\r\nSTEVE BAYT PARMA,Ohio\r\n\r\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLCeQyxVWB8&t=690s",
