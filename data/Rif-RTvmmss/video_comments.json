Damn, the loneliness I felt when I realized GOD and I are ONE was one of the worst feelings I will ever feel in this existence, but feeling the power of GOD was so intense and just felt so right I looked up at the SUN and saw GOD looking at me, then I looked down at my hands and realized that I was ONE with the SUN GOD, I felt like I was the SUN AKA A MF STARBOY. ALSO I dont know if the females that would come by and give me dirty looks were your friends, but damn I would be mad too if I woke up every morning and had to see that face in the mirror \ud83d\ude02",
