        "text": "Curtains by Ed Sheeran\nOnce upon a time, I dared a game to conceal myself. \n\nYou might be familiar with this latest single from Ed Sheeran. The first time I heard this song, I was walking from capitol street to my home and it\u2019s 4:33pm in the afternoon. The first few lines caught my attention as I looked up to see the sun shining brightly. \n\u201c Can you pull the curtains? Let me see the sunshine\nI think I'm done with my hidin' place, and you found me anyway\u201d that soothing voice that made me look where the sun was, I felt that.\n\u201cIt's been forever, but I'm feelin' alright\nTears dry and will leave no trace, and tomorrow's another day\u201d For too long, I've been hiding and seeking my true inner thoughts, and now it seems I've lost my way on the right path, with no footprints to follow. How can I find my way back?\n\n\u201cHide and seek\nI am somewhere closed away\nYou won't believe\nHow long it's been since we started the game\u201d\nOnce upon a time, I dared a game which involves hiding my \u201cself\u201d and appearing as if i were no one, nothing, or even someone else. Every day, I pretend as if I don't feel anything. It's been forever, and I can't seem to find which box contains my self. Nevertheless, I'm feeling alright this is just a matter of talking sense to myself. Yet every single day, I feel like I am no longer who I was before. And everyday, it just gets harder for me to look where I should start searching. I find myself stuck in a stage where I am waiting for the curtains to be pulled.\n\n\"Let me see the sunshine, shine, shine\nLet me see the sunshine, shine, shine\nLet me see the sunshine, shine, shine\nLet me see the sunshine\u201d \ud83c\udfb6\nIf I could describe the state of \u201cmy self\u201d right now, I'd say I'm like a nimbus cloud that always brings rain over the beautiful landscape in the heavenly, breathtaking countryside.\n\n\u201cLife can be\nSo beautiful if you try\u201d\nDarkness has consumed my body and my self nowhere to be found. Perhaps, I am a robot who\u2019s supposed not to feel sadness and follow anyone whom I perceive as superior to me. Despite this, I always try to make a memory and make a meaning out of the day that I spent with anyone I encounter in this world. \n\n\"Are you okay?\" Yeah, I guess so\nBut on some days, I feel like I'm trapped in a hole\nBut I keep quiet, so the ones around me don't know\u201d\n\nSome days, when I look in the mirror, I find myself asking if I truly am this person. Or am I within a different body? Is this my consciousness? Why do our opinions occasionally differ? Nonetheless, I keep these thoughts to myself, fearing that others might perceive me as somewhat losing my mind\u2014even though the truth is that I'm on the brink of flying and leaving this body. \n\n\n\u201cThat the mountain feels so steep\nAnd I'll say that I'm here to help to carry the load\nAnd the outside rays, they are good for the soul\nSo let's step out of the dark, 'cause in here, it's so cold\nThe day's not out of reach and that's when you say to me\n\"Can you pull the curtains, let me see the sunshine?\nI think I'm done with my hidin' place, and you found me anyway\nIt's been forever, but I'm feelin' alright\nTears dry and will leave no trace, and tomorrow's another day\"\nLet me see the sunshine, shine, shine\nLet me see the sunshine, shine, shine\nLet me see the sunshine, shine, shine\nLet me see the sunshine. \u201c\n\nWHERE IS THAT RAY OF SUNSHINE IN ME?\n\nI snapped back to reality and found myself growing angrier listening to this song as I walked through this bustling city. The intense sunshine feels like it's roasting me. Tomorrow is another day, another chance for the sunshine to lead me into contemplation or perhaps the rain will grace us for the next few days. As I walk uphill, I glance back and am completely in awe, noticing the heart of this place. Cebu City is truly a wonder, but which weather suits this city better? Is it rainy or becoming dry?",

So now we go first, in only one day, or today, and then we say NO to the rest of you, of another sort and kind around, as the sexual industry here, all of it too, so thank you for nothing here, all of it too, ok!!!

This song describes my ex boyfriend Ian really well he has major anxiety and never really opened up to me and I know deep down we are the perfect match .. this song and others have helped me to release the emotions that I've been hiding . I can't think about moving on just yet my ex means the world to me and I feel like I've lost the love of my life and I'm slowly crumbling to pieces . Your music has brought me strength and helped me over come depression and helped me deal with my learning disability as well. I love you so much!! Thank you for everything \ud83d\udc9b. I can't wait to see you on July 1st at Gillette Stadium!!",

Ed, I know you may never read this, but I just wanted to express my gratitude for existing and being such an inspiration to us all. Your music, especially this album, has helped me to tap into a range of emotions that I didn't even know existed within me. It's so rare to come across such a flawless masterpiece that allows us to feel and express ourselves so freely. I understand that you've been going through a tough time lately, and as someone who can relate to the lyrics on a personal level, I won't just say that everything will be okay soon. But I truly hope that this difficult journey leads you and all of us to a happier place, where moments of joy can coexist with any sadness we may feel. This album has been like a breath of fresh air for me, keeping me going and giving me hope when everything else seemed bleak. Ed, please never doubt your incredible talent. Year after year, you continue to prove yourself as a gifted magician of music, lyrics, and emotions. Wishing you and your family all the best.\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f",

The choreography is horrible and doesn't apply. Ed should know that what an embarrassment.  He was on AI the other night, man was he boring and added nothing to the show. The song he sang was also very sad.  I guess Ed is just sad Ed. And by the way, I never even heard of Ed Sheeran before.",

It makes me feel like back to the past when I listened song \"perfect\". \n\nRecently, in my opinion, you made a bright, fast, mechanical song to keep up with the trend. I also liked that. \nBut this album seems to be back to your old style, and I love it. I love the melody and lyrics that only you can make, and I love to say everything you want to say through the song. \nWhen I first listened to this album, it reminded me of 2016 when I heard your song first time, and then I could feel the feeling I felt at the time. Thank you a lot.\nThere are people who like your bright and fast songs, but there are many people who like your original style, slightly gloomy, calm, and lyrical melodies like me. Because these calm and talking songs are very comfort and soothe tired hearts.\ud83d\udc97\n\nThank you for working hard on this album, and saying your story honestly in the song. \nPlease continue to make calm songs that are your own style.\nAnd please come to Korea for a concert. \nHere are a lot of people who love you and your song. We are waiting for you come to Korea.\ud83d\ude4f\nLastly, as much as you've had a tough 2022, I hope you'll have a 2023 full of happiness things.\nAlways be happy and healthy. I'll always cheer for you from a far\ud83d\udc4d",

Maybe, don't ask\n'Cause you know I never like to talk about that\nKeep it inside, yeah, you say I always hold back\nAnd I always wear long sleeves\nIs it in your childhood? Something happen in your past?\nWell, the sadness, yeah, I promise that it won't last\nAnd if I could, I would try to take it all back\nThere's still more underneath\nAnd it's when you say to me\n\nCan you pull the curtains?\nLet me see the sunshine\nI think I'm done with my hiding place\nAnd you found me anyway\nIt's been forever, but I'm feeling alright\nTears dry and will leave no trace\nAnd tomorrow's another day\n\nLet me see the sun shine, shine, shine\nLet me see the sun shine, shine, shine\nLet me see the sun shine, shine, shine\nLet me see the sun shine\n\nHide and seek\nCount to ten and close your eyes\nTry to breathe\nSee a message and don't reply\nNice to meet, but in reality, say goodbye\nLife can be so beautiful, if you try\n\nAre you okay? Yeah, I guess so\nBut on some days, I feel like I'm trapped in a hole\nBut I keep quiet, so the ones around me don't know\nThat the mountain feels so steep\nAnd I'll say that I'm here to help to carry the load\nAnd the outside rays, they are good for the soul\nSo let's step out of the dark, 'cause in here, it's so cold\nThe day's not out of reach\nAnd it's when you say to me\n\nCan you pull the curtains?\nLet me see the sunshine\nI think I'm done with my hiding place\nAnd you found me anyway\nIt's been forever, but I'm feeling alright\nTears dry and will leave no trace\nAnd tomorrow's another day\n\nLet me see the sun shine, shine, shine\nLet me see the sun shine, shine, shine\nLet me see the sun shine, shine, shine\nLet me see the sun shine",
