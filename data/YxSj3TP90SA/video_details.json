Maybe don\u2019t ask \n\u2018Coz you know I never like to talk about that\nKeep it inside, yeah you say I always hold back\nAnd I always wear long sleeves\nIs it in your childhood? Something happen in your past?\nWell the sadness, yeah I promise that it won\u2019t last\nAnd if I could I would try to take it all back\nBut there\u2019s still more underneath\nAnd it\u2019s when you say to me \n\nCan you pull the curtains,\nLet me see the sunshine?\nI think I\u2019m done with my hiding place\nAnd you found me anyway\nIt\u2019s been forever but I\u2019m feeling alright\nTears dry and will leave no trace\nAnd tomorrow\u2019s another day\n\nLet me see the sun shine, shine, shine\nLet me see the sun shine, shine, shine\nLet me see the sun shine, shine, shine\nLet me see the sun shine\n\nHide and seek\nCount to ten and close your eyes\nTry to breath\nSee a message and don\u2019t reply\nNice to meet, but in reality say goodbye\nLife can be so beautiful if you try\n\nAre you okay? Yeah I guess so\nBut on some days I feel like I\u2019m trapped in a hole\nBut I keep quiet so the ones around me don\u2019t know\nThat the mountains feels so steep\nAnd I\u2019ll say that I\u2019m here to help to carry the load\nAnd the outside rays, they are good for the soul\nSo let\u2019s step out of the dark \u2018coz in here it\u2019s so cold\nThe day\u2019s not out of reach\nAnd it\u2019s when you say to me \n\nCan you pull the curtains,\nLet me see the sunshine?\nI think I\u2019m done with my hiding place\nAnd you found me anyway\nIt\u2019s been forever but I\u2019m feeling alright\nTears dry and will leave no trace\nAnd tomorrow\u2019s another day\n\nLet me see the sun shine, shine, shine\nLet me see the sun shine, shine, shine\nLet me see the sun shine, shine, shine\nLet me see the sun shine",
