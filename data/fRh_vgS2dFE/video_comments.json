I have never eaten meat because I am very poor. It has been 10 years that I have not bought clothes even for Eid. We wear people's old clothes. Please have mercy. Is there any good person in this world who can help me. I earn one dollar a day but who can meet the expenses of my family in this age. I have a dream. Who is the good person who can fulfill my dream? If possible, I would like to buy a rickshaw taxi for myself and serve my parents on it. I am living in such poverty that you guys can't even imagine. You guys give me one dollar and two for me. of one month. And after that we will also help the poor people, thank you very much",

OK so he hit her in the head and the neck. He smacked her butt really hard and she and she covered it because she didn\u2019t like it again so he slams the door on Haley and with Selena Gomez he treats her nicely. He talks classically to her. He open the door for her. He kisses her, but not to Haley he does not do the stuff what I just said to Haley he only treats Selena Gomez good but not Haley, so please if you believe me like this, Karla",
