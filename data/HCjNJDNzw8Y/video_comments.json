(Los Funcionarios y Maestros deben leer y releer el plan de ense\u00f1anza y los lineamientos y pol\u00edticas del Gobierno para recordar los lineamientos, pol\u00edticas y lineamientos del Gobierno).\n\nEspero que la Uni\u00f3n de J\u00f3venes, los funcionarios locales y la escuela, el personal del puesto de salud de la comuna trabajen juntos regularmente para ir a la escuela a difundir conocimientos m\u00e1s \u00fatiles y equipar a los estudiantes con habilidades para la vida, los estudiantes tengan conocimientos sobre la prevenci\u00f3n de ahogamiento y la prevenci\u00f3n de drogas. de los males sociales, propaganda sobre la ley sobre el orden y la seguridad del tr\u00e1fico, propaganda para mantener a los estudiantes alejados del juego de los desmayos en l\u00ednea, propaganda para que los estudiantes ya no peleen, no a la violencia escolar, independientemente de la regi\u00f3n, propaganda para que los estudiantes digan no al racismo y discriminaci\u00f3n de color, promover que los estudiantes vivan la igualdad de g\u00e9nero, prestar m\u00e1s atenci\u00f3n a la educaci\u00f3n sexual y al sexo seguro para los estudiantes (cada a\u00f1o en Vietnam hay m\u00e1s de 300 mil casos de aborto en edad escolar \"un n\u00famero muy alto y muy peligroso para los estudiantes . estudiantes\" (muchos profesores tienen miedo de los estudiantes y no se atreven a equiparlos con conocimientos sobre sexo seguro, por lo que todav\u00eda falta mucho conocimiento sobre la seguridad sexual de los estudiantes, por lo que los profesores no tienen miedo, pero tratan de superar la barrera del miedo por la salud y seguridad de nuestros queridos estudiantes). En la Escuela se debe propagar un d\u00eda al mes, la educaci\u00f3n es sustantiva y profunda. 20 d\u00edas deben propagarse a los miembros de la Uni\u00f3n Juvenil en la sede del Comit\u00e9 Comunal 1 d\u00eda. La gente deber\u00eda aportar ideas con valent\u00eda al Oficial. S\u00f3lo temo que los estudiantes carezcan de conocimientos \u00fatiles y habilidades para la vida, no demasiado.\n\nDurante las vacaciones de verano y cuando no est\u00e1n en la escuela, los estudiantes tienen mucho tiempo en casa para pasar el rato con amigos, por lo que los padres deben dotar a sus hijos de conocimientos \u00fatiles y habilidades para la vida todos los d\u00edas y recordarles que cuando salgan con amigos, no se inviten entre s\u00ed. pelear, no discriminar por motivos de raza y color, no se les permite usar drogas, no se les permite fumar marihuana, no se les permite fumar ketamina, no se les permite fumar pelota de risa, no fumar marihuana americana, no jugar juegos de p\u00f3quer en l\u00ednea, no jugar apuestas de f\u00fatbol, \u200b\u200bno confiar en grupos para n\u00fameros de loter\u00eda en l\u00ednea, no jugar a la loter\u00eda, no jugar al p\u00f3quer en l\u00ednea, no est\u00e1 permitido jugar apuestas de f\u00fatbol (jugar a la loter\u00eda es jugar al p\u00f3quer en l\u00ednea, jugar apuestas de f\u00fatbol es beber alcohol para refrescarse). no se inviten a nadar en el mar, no vayan a nadar al r\u00edo sin que un adulto los acompa\u00f1e. Los padres deben decirles a sus hijos cuando van a la escuela que escuchen al maestro, que no sean rebeldes, si la rebeld\u00eda es castigada por el maestro, no deben rega\u00f1ar al maestro. Los estudiantes que tienen 14 o 15 a\u00f1os van a llegar a la pubertad, por lo que los padres deben recordarles que si sienten algo por ni\u00f1os y ni\u00f1as, deben saber controlarse y si cruzan el l\u00edmite, usar cond\u00f3n o tomar pastillas anticonceptivas.

No you are not easily angered Bc youre an Aries no you don't like the color black bc you're a Scorpio no youre not lazy bc you're a taurus literally sloth is a sin and black is the color of darkness and God is the light and the demons hate God so they love the dark and when I started following God he opened me and my sisters eyes to realize zodiac signs aren't real many go too astrology and tarot for their future or whats meant for them but never to God or the bible they want what's fun but sadly these are demonic things believe it or not :( me and my sister use to be so caught up in astrology and stuff like that but Not anymore so no you're not that way bc of zodiac signs it's your sins idc how accurate it seems don't be deceived \u2764idk if you are gonna read this but i will tell you and everyone God is real 100% believe it or not and what good is it too gain the whole world and lose your own soul? The bible Aka Gods word never said Good people go to heaven and bad people go too hell Far from true! Nobody not no one can work their way into heaven you cant offer God nothing to get in its a free gift you receive it by faith!

Hell was made for the devil and his angels you should watch billy garham give your life to Jesus we are in the last days and Jesus loves you and he shedded blood on that cross without the shedding of blood sin cannot be forgiven and sin is very serious in the eyes of god  I was depressed to and sinned for fun I had suicidal thoughts I remember in my room one night I told god that of things don't change I'm gonna kms I was sorry weak and at sometimes so weak I felt like I was dying then I remember a really good day came a day I loved so much and wanted more of so on that same day I remember saying god, I'm just gonna trust you and when you try to do something right the devil attacks you so the next day was horrible I don't wanna say how it was it was just horrible! I stayed strong BC after so long of trying to go to anything else but god they all failed me so I held on to god as the reason let me skip to now and say I started off faithless now I'm so faithful in god I started off worried for my future now I know its something gods gonna handle I'm not feeling depressed anymore the whole year of 2022 was hard but with god I made it threw! Now I learned so much and love my relationship with god I know he loves and cares for me AND HE LOVES AND CARES FOR YOU TOO! I remember I was depressed and believed god didn't love me or care for me but that what the devil telling me lies and I had so many demons but now its 2023 I'm free!\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc95 give god your life today he can do things unimaginable\ud83d\udc51\ud83d\ude07 please don't waste time we are in the last days the bible never said just be a good person and be nice to people and you will go to heaven No you need to be willing to give up sin anything evil bad is sin even evil thoughts come to Jesus today you never know when its too late\ud83d\udc95 and also hell is full of constant suffering and nightmare and you are forever alone Guys the bible tells us more people go too hell than heaven if you live in sin and don't repent you won't be saved and god doesn't send people to hell if they go too hell they go of free choice!
