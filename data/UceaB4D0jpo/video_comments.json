This song already has good vocals and lyrics, but the 8D version gives it more reverb and also makes it feel like the music is literally circling around your head.

Children usually learn this song at school and it is something us as a Global Citizens should be proud of and know the lyrics by heart, word by word. Nobody walks anymore, which is sad. Cameras are everywhere, even in our homes. Everyone lives their lives assisted by several different AI systems from birth to death, one is never alone. But I am happy in that time. I just come here sometimes to relax and be disconnected from the world of that time.",
