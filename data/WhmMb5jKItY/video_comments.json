La banda de Chicago liderada por Jeff Tweedy lleva m\u00e1s de veinte a\u00f1os ofreciendo buena m\u00fasica, marcada por el rock y el sonido americano, ahora nos anuncian su nuevo disco, su decimotercer trabajo de estudio, que se va a titular \"Cousin\" y que lanzar\u00e1n el pr\u00f3ximo 29 de septiembre. Sobre la canci\u00f3n \"Evicted\" el propio Tweedy ha se\u00f1alado que \"las heridas autoinfligidas todav\u00eda duelen y, seg\u00fan mi experiencia, es casi imposible recuperarse por completo de ellas\u201d.\r\n\"Cousin\" est\u00e1 compuesto por diez nuevas canciones. Adelantan que la escocesa Cate Le Bon (Deerhunter, Kurt Vile), destacada figura del avant-rock y folk europeo, se suma al proyecto. Es probable que alguno de esos temas caigan en las actuaciones por nuestro pa\u00eds que arrancan el pr\u00f3ximo 12 de agosto con motivo de la celebraci\u00f3n del Sonorama Ribera 2023.\nM\u00fasica independiente novedades.",
