The music industry is getting more and more aggressive, and more and more litigious every day. Why does Kante think he has the right to strangle Dua and her creativity in this way? It doesn't make him look good. And who do we find at the bottom of this mess? Yes, you guessed it, devious and greedy American lawyers (this time in LA), getting rich off of angry people waging war in the courts. Somebody should rid the world of American aggression, nationalism and confrontation. It would make the world a more peaceful, harmonious place. (And yes, another reason this is happening is because Dua Lipa is British/Albanian, not American. Prejudice, xenophobia and misogyny are a part of it, and they are all trademarks of American society.)",
