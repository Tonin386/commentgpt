Super creative concepts underrated and Kendrick Lamar not only one that can pull off great different videos.

People's vision is blur only  focused on the bag is it possible i can hear some real raps fuck you if u cant fuck with that. I'm not with it what happened to the love for the music this is why we miss 2pac. Manipulation and cash grab what has it come too where the j.coles at? please don't let this art end bad tired of bad ending. Rewrite the script shake it up tell kayne we need him bad..real bad. Tems music is fire I have hope  Need to see the love in the art where the fuck its at. Let's take a few steps back and appreciate the fact Drake did that. Not one fumbles or Sak he did that tell a friend to tell another friend we need to put some respect on facts. Include that man rather have someone like that on my side u a hater if we can't appreciate that.",
