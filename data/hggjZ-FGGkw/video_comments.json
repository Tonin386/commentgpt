        "text": "Yeah, this is a good song and yeah, he has a lot of emotion in it. However, I can\u2019t help but to be concerned because he\u2019s showing big signs of drug abuse. I had to watch it twice to show my husband (who\u2019s in recovery), and it triggered him. He said, \u201che\u2019s high\u201d and I had to painfully agree because I watched my now husband act the same way when he was high. No one is saying anything about this, and it sucks because these lyrics alone scream that he\u2019s beat. And all anyone can do is applaud his acting and vocals. He\u2019s a real person, and he\u2019s in trouble. I\u2019m a HUGE fan, always have been. So, this is not meant to be an ill intended comment. I just needed to point out that Post is struggling and none of you noticed. Maybe none of you have seen anyone in active addiction (with opiates specifically), but they act just like this. Slow. Eyes closed. Hands doing weird things. That drowsy putting hand to the mouth movement. It just makes me really sad to see him this way. I truly hope he isn\u2019t battling addiction, we have lost so many artists/actors recently due to overdoses. But, he has made it clear as day that he\u2019s in overdrive. And when people are in overdrive, they find something to slow down. My thoughts are with Posty.",

But these music record lables wan to make you do things yo dont wanna do. You have a daufhter now posty, focus on her. Don;t give into he ikuninnari and demonic forces. you;re a kind and humble dude. I can promise you; all the fame, money, anc celenritiy status is nothing compared to live a comfortanlr and healthy lifestyle with your daughter whike independently doing it so your nothing over your head from these record labels. Use the money you've earned and move your daughter to a big home, where its safe and she gets your undivided attention. She will appreciate you for that in the future when she gets older,  you have  no idea, I hope you read this,- Nikki, Lindsey trosdahls sister, she is friends with Adam Degross.",
