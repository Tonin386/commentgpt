    "description": "Post Malone - Overdrive | Vevo Official Live Performance\n\nPost Malone was never simply one thing. His skills are as broad as his artistic vision is vast \u2013 and it\u2019s always been that way. Listen to \u201cWhite Iverson\u201d again. That 2016 nugget was just as much a pop fever dream as it was a cornerstone of Soundcloud rap. Seems like our hero has been in perpetual evolution since day one. Connect the dots between \u2018beerbongs & bentleys\u2019 and \u2018Twelve Carat Toothache\u2019 and you\u2019ll see a lot of territory being covered in a very logical and very compelling way. Now we\u2019re waiting for \u2018Austin,\u2019 Posty\u2019s latest and perhaps most revealing work to date (his real name is Austin Richard Post). It arrives July 28, and the singer has told fans that it\u2019s \u201csome of the most challenging and rewarding music for me, a least \u2013 trying to really push myself and really do some cool stuff.\u201d To celebrate the arrival of his fifth full album, we united with Mr. Malone in SoCal last month. The results are stellar, with Post being deeply candid and deeply expressive for the cameras. With a fetching pop perspective, he\u2019s leveling up once again, no doubt. Check this performance of \u201cOverdrive,\u201d one of the 17 songs from the new album, and stay close as we roll out more performances soon.\n\nWatch music videos by Post Malone:  https://www.youtube.com/@postmalone\n\nFollow Post Malone:\nhttps://www.postmalone.com\nhttps://instagram.com/postmalone\nhttps://twitter.com/postmalone\nhttps://facebook.com/postmalone\nhttps://snapchat.com/add/postmalone\nhttps://tiktok.com/@postmalone\nhttps://discord.gg/post-malone\n\nFollow Vevo\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/vevo\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/vevo\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vevo\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@vevo\n\nExecutive Producer: JP Evangelista\nExecutive Producer: Chris Pereira\nExecutive Producer: Jordy Wax\nDirectors: Skyler Brown & Seth Halter\nCreative Director, Production: Liz Hart\nLine Producer: Haley Sliger\nLine Producer: Stacey Branson\nProduction Manager: Cole Emery\nDirector Of Photography: Zoe Simone-Yi\nProduction Designer: Tyler Jensen\nMusic & Talent: Annie Shapiro + Sam Mackoff\n\nPresident, Mercury Records: Tyler Arnold\nEVP, Marketing Strategy, Republic Records: Marleny Reyes\nVP, Commerce, Republic Records: Ryan Stevens\nAssociate Director, Commerce (Video), Republic Records: Katie Baumstein\nSVP, Digital Strategy, Republic Records: Tim Hrycyshyn\nSenior Director, Digital Strategy, Republic Records: Allegra Chautin\n\n1st AD: Derek Jaeschke\n2nd AD: Delaney Forrey\n1st AC: Pancho Ortiz\n2nd AC: Kate Ruthenbeck\nDIT: Shawn Aguilar\nSteadicam Operator: Jose Espinoza\nCrane Camera Operator: Chris Herr\nCrane Operator: Garrett Dorin\nCrane Tech: Nazariy Hatak\nRemote Head Tech: Alexandre Nunez\n\nGaffer: Nick Durr\nBB Electric: Jasper Khadjenouri\nElectric / Driver: Victor Noel Arenal\nElectric: Justin Roxbrough\nElectric: Rodolfo Martinez\nElectric: Isaac Han\nElectric: Charlie Hayes\nBoard Operator: Patrick Mattes\n\nKey Grip: Luke Poole\nBB Grip: Justen Hernandez\nGrip: Steven Albovias\nGrip: Nick Herman\nGrip: Grayson Venters\nGrip: Ryan Elvira\n\nArt Director: Danny Erb\nSet Decorator: Michael Coursey\nLeadman: Montana Bertoletti\nSet Dresser / Shopper: Christina Skilbred\nSet Dresser: Eric Moore\nSet Dresser: Kris Ingram\nScenic Painter: Jesse Hotchkiss\nSet Dresser: Abe Turner\n\nArtist Management: Dre London\nArtist Management: Bobby Greenleaf\nArtist Management: Austin Rosen\nProduction Manager, Artist: Dennis A.
