        "text": "Man, let me tell you about Post Malone's latest album, \"Austin.\" It's an absolute masterpiece! I've been listening to each and every track, and I can't help but feel completely captivated. Post Malone's voice is just as mesmerizing and emotionally charged as ever, keeping me hooked from start to finish. Songs like \"Energy,\" \"Reflections,\" and \"Love and Life\" hit me right in the feels. The music on this album is diverse and unique, blending various genres seamlessly. I find myself grooving to the infectious beats and getting lost in the stories he tells. \"Austin\" is a musical journey that's worth every second of your time.\n\nWhat I love about this album is the way it showcases Post Malone's growth as an artist. He's really come into his own, effortlessly combining different musical elements to create something truly special. The lyrics are introspective and thought-provoking, touching on themes of love, self-reflection, and the ups and downs of life. It's evident that Post Malone poured his heart and soul into this project, and it shines through in every song.\n\nThe production value on \"Austin\" is top-notch. Each track is meticulously crafted, creating a rich sonic landscape that draws you in. The attention to detail is remarkable, and the guest features add even more depth and dimension to the album. It's clear that Post Malone surrounded himself with talented collaborators, resulting in a cohesive and immersive listening experience.\n\nOverall, \"Austin\" is a phenomenal album that showcases Post Malone's artistry and musical prowess. It's a testament to his growth and evolution as an artist, and it's clear that he's pushing boundaries and exploring new sounds. If you haven't checked it out yet, I highly recommend giving it a listen. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.",

You shall be saved.\nSay this prayer with mouth and believe it in your heart by Faith and you're saved.\n\nSay 'Lord Jesus, have mercy on me, I've sinned and come short of your glory. Please forgive me. I believe that you died on the cross of Calvary for me and rose on the 3rd day. Save me Lord Jesus. Give me the grace to live for you till the end. Don't let me fall away. Keep me in your will and sustain me in your grace, in Jesus Name. Amen'\n\nIf you've done this, welcome friend. You're now a member of the body of Christ.\n\nIt doesn't end there, though. Develop a personal relationship with God by praying to Him and reading your Bible daily and make conscious effort not to go back to your former life.\u2764\ufe0f\n\nJoin a Bible Believing Faith church close to you & become a part of the physical body of Christ.\u2764\ufe0f\n\nGod will give you the grace to live for Him till the end in Jesus Name.

Cowardice when it comes to leaving even though you know you should (and know you shouldn't have blundered into it so quickly). Basing your relationship on passion as if that's going to sustain a relationship when it matters, etc. So basically it's a guy singing about being a piece of shit and knowing it. Good song as far as that's concerned. However, if this is him talking about himself and people embrace it on how \"open\" he is as an artist I'd still suggest considering the dude is telling you he's a piece of shit.",

        "text": "never trust me, i just like talking, but like not normal talking, it's more like i know what you need, but like i'm always angry and like it's real lovely being your friend, but like don't explain that to me, just be yourself, but like i don't know how you would do that, but like we gotta figure it out as like the whole thing is a pretty light show from a distance and you look down on the city and then c the difference of the light and electricity directions and we all just sit in awe as there was nothing real about it as we were all hugging a tiny coil in our pocket and then seeing the other side of it and then like its really cool how bright that was and our heads move together but seperately but we are all aware of the next people next to us and like also we can stretch across the sea just by looking  you feel the sadness and then you go to the sea for a dip and it's near impossible on a beach that is full but you run into it with underwear on and then you leave and then while people pass by you wait for that moment to cover up as nothing should ever be seen and the reasoning behind that is that its all about manners. if everyone had a tattoo I would also get a tattoo, but it's not socially acceptable, and so i would wait im a bit out of it at the moment, but i'm not doing too bad , and it's a like minded manner where i am and what i think on much of anything and i do wonder at this speed what this is like and or what this means and yet this isn't the end and or the start, but there is no middle at this point and it does seem like this is a version of me, i haven't talked to in a while, but at the same time i would wonder what kind of person would write this and find it necessary to share this at the same tempo and moment as when everybody else is talking about it, but then again i would wonder what we would do if this did happen in this scenario and did i just and or did i just think to admit something which was crucial to the planning and or did i ever think to think that this was a good reasoning and or spectacle to find someone helpful or did i ever think to say that this was the last time i was here as I do wait for the finish on things as there was no other good point in time that i would say that this is going to be okay, but i do think that i have to make it up to you and or say that this and that should never be seen out in the open and it's supposed to live in your head as they are cool, but what if people were talking under these art pieces and what ever i say was recorded and spread in a definition of which this means what and when to someone and or what if i just wanted my own things to be private and not broken down and shared across the world and or  have a say as to what the timing is and why would i ever explain things to you unless i am trying to kill you. \"i have you on notice\" i will put a knife i have had wired up in the refridgerator and turn on the microwave and scan it.  its a killers knife everyone knows how antsy everyone in the whole place of  places are and i do not have much to say about much of anything and this is yet a fun game i do like and i do not care much for it and or what it is and i do think this is exact and the exercise i would look for if i had this written out and or even better we do speak in the same exact way as this and there is not much to say about it, and this is not even the best one out there as i do have which i spent years wiping into my mind only to be   killed by the knife i have wrapped in unknowns hand touched and in a jack to the pc.  etc etc.  i got this strung from africa to china for the most part    ferite   etc etc .   its alot of fun thinking about this, i must be insane and i am writing a book, \"let me add,bang\" i am funny and weird.   i am niether and this is a shit thing all of you know nothing about and how dare you write the bullshit you do as i am finished with the  and the and god us maybe right possibly and then i say  i forgot and i dont mistep and or    mis shook and or mistook and i say this is the kind of thing i would do with a full mind but i am under my own head right now and basically there is nothing real or not and you might and or might not   and till death do us part. there is no tommorow, remember the day , hill top gang , you stand on it and you dont leave, we all die together until there is no one left and the essence of it , is i want to sleep with a ball. \"eye defined everything to your nothing\"   you better watch yourself , something might be a monster and come after you. they do or don't but nuclear christmas wont work unless we do have that sprinkle in the air?    why do some get to be where and when others say things do i have to respond and or is this even close to what morphine is and or the death count is , have that hinge coming at me right at me all day. i am looking to find this fun and a little bit of , i only think about one thing and that is the look in my eyes and you can fake that and or think about what i am and or talk about what you dont know but dont ever wipe yourself and or think to forget who you are and or what you have and or have not done as this initself means much to do about nothing and i just think to my self that this is a good thing and there is a chance and a take to rake and make till their is a pile. \"please share this on your own time\" no and yes, there is no owned time and this is not your or mine, but i did define something which was not done and i dont think much about the fact that a metal plate under a keyboard is a eink display when displays uh oh. kid popper.  i got alot of this . im really looking to end things, and then leave this place straight for home and leaving you all here. \"i know where you are going\"   straight to jail\" dude i am the filing cabinet -\"mi6\"",

        "text": "The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in \u201cadvanced\u201d countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human being to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in \u201cadvanced\u201d countries. The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine. Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy. If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later. We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system. This revolution may or may not make use of violence; it may be sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades. We can\u2019t predict any of that. But we do outline in a very general way the measures that those who hate the industrial system should take in order to prepare the way for a revolution against that form of society. This is not to be a POLITICAL revolution. Its object will be to overthrow not governments but the economic and technological basis of the present society. In this article we give attention to only some of the negative developments that have grown out of the industrial-technological system. Other such developments we mention only briefly or ignore altogether. This does not mean that we regard these other developments as unimportant. For practical reasons we have to confine our discussion to areas that have received insufficient public attention or in which we have something new to say. For example, since there are well-developed environmental and wilderness movements, we have written very little about environmental degradation or the destruction of wild nature, even though we consider these to be highly important.",
