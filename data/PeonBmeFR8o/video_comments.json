She stormed off her face look pissed asf.  Wasn't really a hard score fan but this album was so relatable and I realized her humanity. I like her more now.  I also feel bad she had her heart SHATTERED!  The pain...SMH, she loved and still loves that man.",

And the names of them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister: and they were mine, and they bare sons and daughters. Thus were their names; Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah. And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbours, which were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses. Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them that were the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with all their idols she defiled herself. Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt: for in her youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her. Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted. These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women; for they had executed judgment upon her. And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredoms. She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours, captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men. Then I saw that she was defiled, that they took both one way, and that she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion, girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity: and as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea. And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated from them. So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister. Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt. For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses. Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth. Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side; the Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable young men, captains and rulers, great Lords and renowned, all of them riding upon horses. And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, which shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments. And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire. They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels. Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom brought from the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more. For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from whom thy mind is alienated: and they shall deal with thee hatefully, and shall take away all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms. I will do these things unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen, and because thou art polluted with their idols. Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her cup into thine hand. Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou shalt drink of thy sister's cup deep and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it containeth much. Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria. Thou shalt even drink it and suck it out, and thou shalt break the sherds thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD. Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms. The LORD said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah? yea, declare unto them their abominations; that they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for them through the fire, to devour them. Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths. For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house. And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far, unto whom a messenger was sent; and, lo, they came: for whom thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst thyself with ornaments, and satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil. And a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with the men of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the wilderness, which put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads. Then said I unto her that was old in adulteries, Will they now commit whoredoms with her, and she with them? Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot: so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the lewd women. And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands. For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company upon them, and will give them to be removed and spoiled. And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire. Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness. And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols: and ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.\u201d\n\u202d\u202dEzekiel\u202c \u202d23\u202c:\u202d2\u202c-\u202d49\u202c \u202dKJV\u202c\u202c https://bible.com/bible/1/ezk.23.2-49.KJV",

And forgive us our sins, For we also forgive everyone who is indebted to us. And do not lead us into temptation, But deliver us from the evil one.\u201d \u201cSo I say to you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. If a son asks for bread from any father among you, will he give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a serpent instead of a fish? If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!\u201d But He said, \u201cMore than that, blessed are those who hear the word of God and keep it!\u201d And while the crowds were thickly gathered together, He began to say, \u201cThis is an evil generation. It seeks a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet. For as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so also the Son of Man will be to this generation. The queen of the South will rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and indeed a greater than Solomon is here. The men of Nineveh will rise up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and indeed a greater than Jonah is here.\u201d\n\u202d\u202dLuke\u202c \u202d11\u202c:\u202d2\u202c, \u202d4\u202c, \u202d9\u202c-\u202d11\u202c, \u202d13\u202c, \u202d28\u202c-\u202d32\u202c \u202dNKJV\u202c\u202c\nhttps://bible.com/bible/114/luk.11.2-32.NKJV\nI\u2019ll be in the nba(national basketball association) one day with vanity as a player, and also become the chief musician reaper light the seeds you sow will reap in vanity, vanities of vanities all is vanity. \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1\u271d\ufe0f\ud83d\udc51\u2696\ufe0f\u231b\ufe0f",

        "text": "Mmh, interesting how your energy exudes or betters transcends many different layers of your existence.Can I be upfront with you.Forget this is a public space or platform but a truth that you undstd will help heal others.I have mastered Spiritual Psychology for about 19 yrs now n this leverages me to have a better grasp of who humans are from a deeper perspective not just superficial or surface level. \n   However, forget the mega personality you have build over time,and if I am a loyal friend,here is the truth. As you rightly say, you are one of the greatest in the game,n the world acknowledges this. No denying,but then it doesn't negate this reality that humans are only a reflection of their natural selves cut in 12 parts. You being a Virgo,mks u the best lover or any kind of relationship with all it's perks. He who doesn't know Virgo love has loved yet. Pretty one, friends speak the truth,ur love ordeal does not mean ur partner does not live u back despite the challenges,but the hidden truth is, we often times refuse to face reality.Virgo/Sagittarius is a no go zone except it's for fun or except that Sagittarius has a very powerful placements in their natal chart which overshadows their sun sign which is their outer personality.\n     Compatibility is what even God don't fail to let us undstd before getting into relationships. You more than anyone else deserves the best of love based on how you love others.The chaotic moods n jealousy,u depicting breaking things comes out of ur true nature showcased in ur videos,an authentic nature of yours the world shld appreciate. This is how Virgo honesty comes out when they are not ok, because they give their best but never reciprocated in the same measure. A little advice,you going for Baptism as shown in the video doing all it tks to get healed from Virgo trauma n betrayal so common with most, doesn't suffice. U wanna get ur love back,nomatter who it is,or continue making such videos,just stand up outside the sun for mins look up with faith n genuineness of the Virgo heart,say God I believe you n I will wrestle you if you donot restore my faith in you and in love.Do so always. I did and it brought my faith in God,n despite me giving up on love,it made me believe there is someone for me out there nomatter what.Only time separates everyone's Divine partner not distance.It could still be any of ur exes,but only God will guide you to that love not determined by fame,wealth, material or canal pleasures. Seek God and love will follow you everywhr u go.Peace",

When otherwise Oshun is a peaceful, loving, and caring diety. Not the heartbroken Beyonce trying to manifest herself and elevate herself to the status of an Orisha when she is but a mere child. She is a child born out of these peaceful waters, but in the video, she has tried to express that she is like oshun destined from the start of her creation and birth in the womb to be a heartbroken woman. \n\n#stop using spirituality for clout #respect the divine feminine #respect the mother of all.",
