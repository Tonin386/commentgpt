I myself have been judged by my appearance for my whole life post puberty. It is hurtful, damaging, ignorant, and it's unacceptable. I want to apologize for doing the same thing to Post Malone that was done to me causing irreparable damage to my self esteem and the way I have valued myself since I was 11 years old. I'm 42 now and people still judge and label me  based on my appearance. I will never let myself do that to another human being ever again. \nThis man is a genius. A true musician. A gentleman. A beautiful human being. A legend. Go Postie go!!",

In 2019, he released Hollywood Bleeding in early September when I was leaving France and my dad while not knowing I would stay 3 years not seeing him (I live in China, and Covid would stop all possibility of travel only a few months later). Post released Twelve Carat Toothache last year just when my dad was diagnosed with Pancreatic Cancer and Austin came out less than a month after my dad passed away. I don't believe in any sign or anything, but all of this gave Postie's songs a very deep meaning in my heart.",
