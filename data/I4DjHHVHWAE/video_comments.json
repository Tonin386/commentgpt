It's been like this since Thank Me Later and probably before. The only reason why he's being interpreted as fruity now is because of what's been doing outside the studio. Drake singing and taking memorable flows is a decade old LOL",

        "text": "One of the reasons why \"Rick Flex\" could be considered a great work of art is its production quality. The beat, produced by Tay Keith, is a perfect blend of trap, hip-hop, and R&B. The beat's bass-heavy sound and unique rhythm have made it one of the most popular beats in recent years. Additionally, the use of auto-tune and other effects on the vocals adds to the song's overall appeal, creating a polished and contemporary sound.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the lyrics in \"Rick Flex\" are engaging and relatable. The song tells the story of Drake and 21 Savage's rise to fame, their current status as successful artists, and the challenges they faced on their journey. The lyrics touch on themes such as money, power, and success, which are topics that many people can relate to. Additionally, the lyrics are cleverly crafted and showcase the artists' lyrical abilities.\r\n\r\nAnother reason why \"Rick Flex\" could be considered a great work of art is the chemistry between Drake and 21 Savage. The two artists complement each other's styles well, with Drake's smooth and melodic flow contrasting 21 Savage's more aggressive and rough delivery. The collaboration between the two artists has been described as seamless, with both artists bringing their unique styles to the song.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while the claim that \"Rick Flex\" is the greatest work of art is subjective, there are reasons why some people may consider it a great work of art. The song's production quality, well-crafted lyrics, and the chemistry between Drake and 21 Savage make it a memorable and engaging piece of music.",

That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can\u2019t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can\u2019t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I\u2019ve come across in my life, and I\u2019m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this  has changed my entire mental state, I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. this is so inspirational, it shares it vast wisdom with all of us, and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. This made me tear up. How could such a good movie do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of art I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of moviemaking I have ever seen especially on 57:42.I am currently crying so hard right now.
