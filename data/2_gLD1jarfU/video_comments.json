People are truly not realizing (and maybe purposefully downplaying) how much of a big deal his music is and will continue to be. It ages like fine wine. As well as Partynextdoor's music. We've been given some of the best music ever created in a span of almost 2 decades. I'm honored to be witnessing it in action. \ud83d\ude4f\nOvO",

Firstly: This isn't no \"making it out the hood track\"\nSecondly: drake doesn't know ANYTHING about 'the hood' or what it's like to live anything but a lavish lifestyle. He grew up in the upper middle class. He never had to want or need for anything!\nNow I'm not one to talk, I also grew up upper middle class in Burlington, on! K, so my fam had money but I also had NOTHING handed to me and worked my ass off for everything I wanted and strived for, just like drake. So what I'm saying is although he's fat from 'hood'\nHe worked his fucking ass off to make something out of himself and that I have mad respect for!\nBut regardless of how I grew up, I've been on the streets homeless, living in some trash shit hood apartment and it's nothing to be proud of. It's a fucking DISGUSTING horrible way to live with retarded crack head neighbours and fucking meth heads yelling and screaming outside your apartment complex all night and shit. God, I'd rather die then EVER go back to the few years I lived in poverty!\nSo I don't get how some ppl seem proud to come from the hood!\nBut listen, \nIf you worked your ass off to 'start from the bottom now your up'\nFuck ya, I salute you!\nBut living in the hood is nothing to celebrate or be proud of like it somehow makes you 'gangster', makes you 'hard' or whatever these fucktardw say\n\nDrake worked his ass off to be where he is\nSo if you love and look up to drake, then use that inspiration to inspire you to accomplish something with your life and life a better life then those ppl you grew up with 'in the hood '!",

        "text": "Its a decent song. But im not getting much of a nostalgic feeling as much as u drake \"fans\" say. He sounds really robotic here. Drake doesn't give us range ir variation anymore. Now thats not to say he was ever a top tier vocalist or sum but idk. He sounds real unnatural here on the singing part. Lyrics i like ofc. When he has a good flow he gets real repetitive with it. Hes been doing that ALOT recently.",

        "text": "Jesus is coming back soon! The Bible foretold all of the things that are happening in the world right now over 2,000 years ago. The New World Order is about to come into power and the world is about to go into the 7 year tribulation, which is going to be literal hell on earth. Everything is coming together exactly like God said it would! Yes, for the world it is a hopeless situation, but the good news is that God has provided an escape through faith in Jesus Christ alone! \n     John 3:16: \u201cFor God so loved the world that he gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him will not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d\n      We are all born sinners and doomed to spend eternity in hell. Romans 3:10 states that \u201cThere is no one righteous, not even one\u201d. \n     Romans 3:23 explains: \u201cFor all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.\u201d We all have a sin debt that we owe God and it is so great that we can never possibly repay it. However, the good news is that Jesus paid that debt by dying and suffering the wrath of God in our place on the cross, and three days later He rose from the dead in ultimate victory over sin and death. \n     Romans 6:23 says: \u201cThe wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.\u201d God loves us more than we can even imagine and is offering every single person forgiveness and salvation, regardless of what anyone has done, if only they repent and put their faith in Jesus Christ alone. We can never do anything to earn salvation no matter how good of a person that we think we are. Isaiah 64:6 states: \u201call our righteous acts are like filthy rags\u201d. But praise God that when we accept Christ as our savior, Jesus gives us His righteousness! It\u2019s a GIFT! \n     Romans 10:9-10 explains: \u201cThat if you confess with your mouth, \u201cJesus is Lord,\u201d and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it\u2028is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.\u201d \n     Romans 10:13 \u201cEveryone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved\u201d. \n\n     Jesus IS Lord and the Bible says one day all will confess that and bow their knee before Him. Unfortunately, there will be many that do that right before they go into eternal torment in the lake of fire. Do it now before it is too late! Jesus is real, He is the Son of God, He gave His life for us, and three days later He rose from the dead. To this day there is an empty tomb in Jerusalem! He is coming back soon to rapture every true believer. Don\u2019t be left behind to experience the wrath of God that\u2019s about to fall on this world. Repent of your sins and get saved now before it\u2019s too late. John 14:6: (Jesus speaking) \u201cI am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.\u201d\n\nHere are a couple links for further information.

Tell you right from wrong\r\nWho's smart from who's the fool\r\nWhich utensil to use for which food, like\r\nI got a schedule to attend to though\r\nI can't really\r\n6ix\r\n\r\n[Verse 1: Drake]\r\nYou bitches really get carried away\r\nMakin' mistakes then you beg me to stay\r\nGot me wiggin' on you like I'm Arrogant Tae\r\nYou got my mind in a terrible place\r\nWhip done changed you like American slaves\r\nAct like you not used to Sheraton stays\r\nI met the nigga you thought could replace\r\nHow were there even comparisons made?\r\nBitch, next time, I swear on my grandmother grave\r\nI'm slimin' you for them kid choices you made\r\n\r\n[Refrain: Drake]\r\nSlimin' you out, slimin' you out, slimin' you out\r\nSee Drake Live\r\nGet tickets as low as $170\r\n\r\nYou might also like\r\nIDGAF\r\nDrake\r\nBalut\r\nDoja Cat\r\nBoyz Don\u2019t Cry\r\nRod Wave\r\n[Verse 2: Drake]\r\nAyy, this ain't the littest I could get on you bitches\r\nSend wires on wires on wires, like Idris\r\nYou lucky that I don't take back what was given\r\nI could have you on payment plan 'til you're hundred and fifty\r\nAnd my slime right here, she got some bars for y'all niggas\r\nSo I'ma fall back and let SZA talk her shit for a minute\r\n\r\n[Refrain: Drake]\r\nSlimin' you out, slimin' you out, slime\r\n\r\n[Verse 3: SZA]\r\nDamn, these niggas got me so twisted\r\nHow the fuck you so real, but play bitch on my line?\r\nI can feel what you spendin'\r\nGot too much pride to let no burnt nigga slime me out\r\nPull up, go ride about, my night, got time\r\nLet's discuss all those lies about\r\nFrontin' out here, like you dickin' me out\r\nAnd I ain't even cumin', numbin' it out\r\nAnd you ain't 'bout the shit you rappin' about\r\nAnd I can spin the ho, I'm airin' it out\r\nI'm goin' on like a sawed-off\r\nYou tell these hoes you ain't cuddlin'\r\nBut with me, you know doin' all that shit\r\nYou tellin' these hoes you ain't trickin' off\r\nBut with me, you know I'm gon' get it all\r\nHow you niggas get so carried away?\r\nTrippin' when that dick is barely third place\r\nFucked out of pity, it's cute that you lame\r\nDip cause it's mid I can't fake liking sex\r\n\r\n\r\n[Refrain: SZA]\r\nSlimin' you out, I'm slimin' you out, I'm slimin' you out\r\nOh-woah, woah\r\n\r\n[Verse 4: Drake]\r\nYeah, January, you pretend to see life clearly, yearly\r\nFebruary is the time that you put the evil eye and the pride aside\r\nFor the fantasy of gettin' married, very scary\r\nMarch got you already second guessin' titles\r\nApril, Spring is here and just like a spring you start to spiral\r\nMay brings some warmer days\r\nPoolside gettin' very tan\r\nJune have you movin' ice cold, goin' back and forth with a married man\r\nJuly, that's when I found out you lied\r\nAugust, it was \"Baby this,\" \"Baby that,\" like you had your tubes tied\r\nSeptember, we fallin' off, but I'm still the man you tryna win over\r\nOctober is all about me 'cause your turn should've been over\r\nNovember, got your moodboardin' for next year and you're single\r\nDecember the gift givin' month and now you wanna rekindle, I\r\nTryna build trust, showin' me your DMs, how they tryna bag you\r\nIronic how the news I got about you ended up bein' bad news\r\nGet a nigga hit for fifty racks, girl, the beef cost like it's Wagyu\r\nGet a nigga hit, I'll make his ass see the light, like a half-moon\r\nShout to QC, pretty sure I made P Ms like it's past noon\r\nAll I really know is Ws and Ms, life lookin' like a bathroom\r\nAll I really know is M bags, like I drove through and ordered fast food\r\nSayin' that I'm too guarded with my feelings, who the fuck even asked you?\r\nSeven bodyguards, just in case somebody really wanna try and crash through\r\nDon't know why I listen to you when I hear you talkin' to me, it's some half truth\r\nIf I don't pay your rent, it end up like a old hairstyle, girl, that's past due\r\nIf I don't\u2014\n\n\n[Outro: Drake]\r\nAh, ah, that's as far as I got",
