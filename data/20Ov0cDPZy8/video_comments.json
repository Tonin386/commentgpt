His expressions and use of tonal range are just right: never too much or underpinned.\n\nIn furtherance, this version of Tom Petty's classic took the song in another direction giving it a whole new life. I'm sure the legend would have been proud when he heard this.\n\nThank you JM.",

Not just listening to something because my parents had it on in the car or house. I was eight at sleep away summer camp for the first time. There was an older girl in my cabin I thought was really cool and looked up to, she was maybe ten LOL, but we were all out on the pontoon boat on the lake just before sunset in the evening and this song was playing on the boat stereo and the older girl was mouthing along to the lyrics. I thought, wow if she likes this song so much and she\u2019s so cool this must be a really cool song. It\u2019s funny how we think when we\u2019re kids but I still remember that moment exactly. I love this song, it always takes me back to the happiest summers of my life",

        "text": "Amazing musician and guitarist.  His choice to leverage \"pop\" music to achieve success often overshadows his amazing vocal, song writing, and guitar playing abilities.  In addition, he admittedly lost his way a bit as his commercial success skyrocketed. But, he is, at the heart, an amazing songwriter, guitarist, and vocalist. You may not like some of his pop songs, but there is no denying he is a generational talent.  I see many a negative comment on his status as a guitarist, but that is a ridiculous discussion. It isn't about who is \"best.\" Rather, it is about music that moves you. There is no \"best.\"  Respect to John Mayer for creating music that moves many of us.  He is, in my opinion, a phenomenally talented artist who pays tribute to those that have come before him while also blazing his own path. And, like all of us, he's also a flawed individual. Such is life. Much peace,  love, and respect to all\ud83d\ude4f",

Many, most artists, see their work fade in the rear view mirror of time, but not John's. It stays crispy fresh like he just cut it yesterday. And it listens and feels fresh to our ears and palettes as well. That's a rare gift and a true blessing, to have music that never gets old... Hallelujah! Truly this is the goal of art when it's done correctly. Kudos to JM! He's a Master, the Man and the King \u2763\ud83c\udf1f\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc51",

It's so smooth and hypnotic. It is possibly the best rendition of any already perfect song I've ever heard, and there's some great ones out there. Tom Petty's version is just one that, when it comes on the radio, you don't change it or ever get tired of it. I guess I always go searching for John Mayer's version because you don't hear it on the radio, and it's pretty special. I'll never get tired of this version either. It's probably the one I'd choose to listen to on an endless loop for eternity, if I had to choose between the two versions.",
