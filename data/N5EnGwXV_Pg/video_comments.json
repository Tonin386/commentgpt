        "text": "I noticed John Mayer for the first time in 2003 when his show \"Any Given Thursday\" was playing in a DirecTV channel. I felt in love with his songs right away. \nI couldn't get out of my house at the time because I had agoraphobia. So I watched a lot of TV. And John's amazing voice comforted me at the time. \nI couldn't leave my house, because I thought I would feel nauseated, dizziness and other symptoms. So I panicked everytime I had to go out. Specially in crowded places. \nI lost contact with friends, I lost contact with the boy I liked. My life was hell... I was miserable. Thought I would never go out of that situation.\nSo, 14 years later John came to Brazil to perform on Allianz Parque, a famous stadium. It was almost full house, and I was there. I mean, I did it! I went to his concert. Something I would never imagined doing: seeing the guy that was one of the things that helped me spend my time while \"locked\" in my house. If I went back in 2003 and said to the 18 years old me that I would see that guy perform in a crowded stadium, I think I wouldn't have believed it.\nThis is one the songs that remind me of that time.\nAlthough I was almost cured from agoraphobia a couple years later, I still have to deal with my mental health till today. But everytime I listen to a song from that time, and in this case, John Mayer's, I see that my life back then was not all dark, there was a light waiting for me, although I couldn't see anything in front of me, only despair.\nSo..\nThank you, John. Just thank you. \ud83d\udc93",

Too Bad girls call men that are like this boring,Lames,Simp, soy, ETC they rather have a toxic relationship with a thug that would end up abusing you and you're loved ones and I've been on both side of that spectrum I've been a thug that was insane and living life like it's the last day ever drinking dancing with anyone selling drugs and other stuff I'll rather not speak about, and girls rather have the bad boy but guess what they won't  get in a serious relationship or marriage unless you knock them up, they see the bad boy as a toy and thing to do while finishing college and then right after that leave them and marry a doctor or a lawyer from their old town. And I always tell young kids that are not thug and very popular in highschools trust me be on your shit let these guys peak in their High School years, and you peak at late 20s early 30s being a millionaire and having the best car while the football QB working on at Amazon",
