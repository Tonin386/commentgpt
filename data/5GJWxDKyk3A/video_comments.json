Romantic relationships, my terrible relationship with my guardian parents, my biological parents, my childhood trauma, and even friendships. I don\u2019t rlly love the screaming but I also don\u2019t mind it. I understand the artistic expression and the point of it, and tbh it\u2019s how I feel abt a lot of things. Like crying and singing softly but also screaming. Both happen a lot in those relationships above. Overall, good song.",

If youre still living in sin listening and worshipping all these celebrities just know you are not with God. You have a choice as you breath God still has mercy on you, you can choose God and salvation. Or Satan and hell once someone dies its heaven or hell. I was a huge fan of karol g, rhianna, eminem, billie eilish, camila cabello, doja cat, harry styles you name it. Until Jesus came into my life, opened my eyes to how evil this world really is and saved me. All celebrities have sold their souls they show it and say it all the time. Satan was in charge of music in heaven before betraying God and the biggest influence in life is music and notice how its all demonic? If youre a unbeliever and a believer who doesnt wanna follow Jesus and His way of life then live your best life because this world is all youre gonna get after its eternal forever pain in torture. Ive experienced hell when i stopped following God for how hard His path was and that traumatized me i choose Life i choose Jesus. If anyone wants to be saved believe in Jesus that He is the son of God and died for your sins and arose on the third day and you shall be saved. The Holy Spirit will be with you to teach, guide, and lead you the way Jesus wants us to live through Him. If a believer wants to be forgiven, REPENT and truly surrender your life to Jesus and let the Holy Spirit lead you to Jesus way of life. In the bible it says YOU CANNOT SERVE TWO MASTERS either youre with God \ud83d\udcaf percent or with the devil.",

I'm leaving this comment cuz this song in whole is so fcking relatable for me I literally failed in my life jus bcuz of my partner and I really wanna die at the same point I love him but at the same point I hate him so so much all the tears I had was just bcoz of him he is the reason why I was always sad and wanted to die just bcoz of him and don't want to see his face again",

It sounds like a divorced mom. Ppl on her video talking about how it is the \"mature version \" that is complete BS. I grew up with her she was the first American idol so yes I like her and grew up on a lot of her songs. However this is YOUR SONG. Not only cause you wrote it but because it is just you. It is not the \"teenage\" version it is the REAL VERSION. Im 32 And I feel the pain in this song. It can apply to a 15 year old or a 60 year old. It doesn't matter. I love how the end turns into a VICTORY and shows how you and we as women are triumphant over men who treat us awful. It is an amazing song that has gotten me through alot. We have all had bfs like this and we have all had to get away from them at one point and this song truly is the anthem of our victory. Not just boyfriend's but any relationship, job, situation, anything. I like alot of your songs, not a SUPER fan, but def a fan. So Im not biased about this lol. It is just the truth. This song is amazing. Really great job and the best version don't listen to anyone else say different.",

They put me down to feel better about themselves, they act like everything is about them, they always start silly arguments, they would always be negative, they would manipulate me and lie to me, they are mentally draining. I was first ashamed that I even thought of ending our friendship, and I tolerate all those actions because I just figured \"they have it so much worse than me, I should let them have a little fun.\" But after finding out they lied to me about so much things, I can't trust them or feel comfortable around them anymore. I'm currently ghosting them since I'm not sure if it's all a delusion I made up, so I chose a safe move just in case they still treasure me and see me as a sister. But it's uncomfortable to greet them in real life, so I want to end our friendship so bad. I don't know what to do anymore.",

        "text": "I adore Billie's music. Her mesmerizing voice. But most importantly, message and experimentation. That's why I also adore \"Lemonade\" (Beyonc\u00e9), \"Songs In The Key of Life\" (Stevie Wonder), and \"What's Going On\" (Marvin Gaye).\n\nUnfortunately, the message of her albums is muddled by her behavior. I'm usualy able to separate it in my mind, but it's still awful. She lip-synced a slur. She said she didn't know, but that's not true: In a separate video she imitated a stereotypical aisian accent. She also queerbaited with Lost Cause because of the kissing that was officially sealed by her posting \"I like girls.\" I'm an uneven pansexual and am genderfluid. I came out for both in 2016. What she did is not okay.",
