(My avenue)\nWhen you (when you) said you were passing through\nWas I even on your way?\n\nI knew when I asked you to (when I asked you to)\nBe cool about what I was telling you\nYou'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (what you said you'd do)\nAnd I'd end up more afraid\n\nDon't say it isn't fair\nYou clearly weren't aware that you made me miserable\nSo if you really wanna know\n\nWhen I'm away from you (when I'm away from you)\nI'm happier than ever (happier than ever)\nWish I could explain it better (wish I could explain it better)\nI wish it wasn't true (wish it wasn't true), mmm-mmm\n\nYou call me again, drunk in your Benz\nDriving home under the influence\nYou scared me to death, but I'm wasting my breath\n'Cause you only listen to your fucking friends\n\nI don't relate to you\nI don't relate to you, no\n'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty\nYou made me hate this city\n\nAnd I don't talk shit about you on the internet\nNever told anyone anything bad\n'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything\nAnd all that you did was make me fucking sad\nSo don't waste the time I don't have\nAnd don't try to make me feel bad\n\nI could talk about every time that you showed up on time\nBut I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did\nNever paid any mind to my mother or friends\nSo I shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid\n\nYou ruined everything good\nAlways said you were misunderstood\nMade all my moments your own\nJust fucking leave me alone",
