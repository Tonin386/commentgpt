Since I was 11 I struggled with alcoholism which lead to other substances, I'm 27 now and have over 8 months sober from alcohol and opiates. Your music has always helped me in the past and it still does now, I never thought I would live to see this age, I've had severe depression in the past which doesn't mix well with addiction. It took alot of help throughout the years for me to finally be able to get sober, also I had to hit my rock bottom before I was ready to make a change. I'm sorry you have to deal with this shit, just please don't let your rock bottom be something you can't recover from. Everybody needs help sometimes, it takes more strength to know when you need to ask for help, I wish I could pull you out of your current mindset and help you see what it can be like down the line. Human to human, alcoholic to alcoholic, I love you Post and I hope everything works out for you.",

We have so much in common.. everyone needs that one person that will hold your hand and walk next to you down the road that your a little afraid to actually go down cause you don't know what the outcome is gonna be. We're both looking at the same road. We could keep each other company walking and talking with each other all the way down that road till we get where each of us wants to be. Everyone needs that one person you can be just yourself without any judgement just able to be happy knowing you can just be you and knowing that you alone is good enough without all this other bullshit people around would like to see in you. I've always said that why change into a person that your not made to be because they like it. People change their minds so quick. So as l9ng as your happy doing what you love then why take away your happiness. \"We\" ourself have to be happy in our own skin before everyone around can be satisfied knowing we are who we are and that's why everyone makes the decision to have those people in their lives \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a",

Nobody\nTake me outside, I'm a little too high\nPaid a little too much for the time of my life\nWhen money ain't a problem, everyone's lyin'\nEven when I tell myself that I\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't wanna sober up\nThe sun is killin' my buzz, that's why they call it mourning\nThought I was strong enough\nThrew my bottle at the sky, said, \"God, that's a warning\"\nDon't wanna sober up\nTry to keep it inside, but I just wanna pour it\nThought I was strong enough\nGot a lotta shit to say, couldn't fit it in the chorus\n\nNote: I get the lyrics from Genius.",
