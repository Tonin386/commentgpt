There is often too much going on, occasional dilemmas and I rarely feel lonely. In fact, the matron still doesn't knock on the door and the orders come from her mouth. They are overconfident and very pushy. Let them march to perdition themselves and get rid of those wanted and beloved. Let them give up their advice, exploitation and money. Nothing good comes out of their mouths, only hatred and contempt. I'm playing a bit in investing, because games interest me less and less. Women are excluded so I still spend time with myself. It's not bad, but it could always be better. \ud83e\udd71\ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude0f",
