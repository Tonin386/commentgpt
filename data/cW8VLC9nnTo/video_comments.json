        "text": "Reading all the comments breaks my heart. We are all women who go through different obstacles in life and yet at the very same time we are all facing the same challenges. We all are women, we were all barbies at one time, but most importantly, we are all healing internally. Our inner childhood is a little girl in desperate need of a hug, In need of her parents apology, in need of someone explaining to her where all of her pain stems from....where all of her insecurities come from. As women , we should all be giving that inner childhood a hug and help our fellow women stand. We should be supporting each other through the pits of life and help support each other. Instead of women tearing women down we need to do the opposite and realize we are all barbies with inner childhoods in need of another friend. If we all helped each other off the ground and helped our fellow sisters by showing support...we as women would be a  lot farther in society than what we currently are if we just stopped tearing each other down and started befriending one another instead. Love you fellow barbie. You are strong, you are beautiful, you are smart, you have value, you have worth, you are creative, wonderful, passionate, and you encompass the dreams of a very important innerchild...yourself. Don't let your dreams die alongside the dreams of little girls everywhere.",

This is because they follow the orthodoxy of Galen who appreciated the classical model.  They confuse the four elements of Galen with food and so they are happy for clients to consume excretions of the other people's bodies.\n\nDo you recall that movie staring Joe Pesce, Robert De Niro and Ray Liotta called 'Good Fellas'?  There's a scene in the movie where a  disgruntled Deli employee spits in a customers sandwich out of eye shot of the Customer and then hands the Customer the sandwich pretending nothing has happened.\n\nSo back to the Question-  Does the Dog know it enjoys it's Bone?\n\nThe answer must be yes because a Dog can discern between animal poo and tinned dog food.  Unless the Dog is starving it will eat tinned dog food.\n\nSo what must that mean to people who conduct felatio on their sex partners?",

        "text": "*(vent)*\n\nAs a 7th grader\u2026 i am touched. Elementary was so care-free, people got along so motherfucking well, and we did just everything you could think of. Now in middle school, people vape in the bathroom, starts random ass fights, anything you could think of. And the teachers keep forgetting I got ADHD and autism and I\u2019m always getting sent to detention. People and my parents are thinking I\u2019m bipolar due to my reoccurring depression. Speaking of parents, there was a stupid ass case where people thought my parents *ABUSED US.* I was so fucking angry. They thought my parents drugged me due to how I act. I\u2019m anxious as fuck and I have a fucking twitching issue, what do you expect out of me?! During that case, I literally got depressed. So severely I was taken to therapy. And I was only 8 years old. (I\u2019m 12 now for your information.) My parents are harsh, yes, but they aren\u2019t abusive. I\u2019ve also been through so much personally. I literally need to draw, wear something warm, listen to headphones on full blast, drink matcha tea and/or coffee, sit alone in my room, and I can\u2019t even *DO THAT.* At home or at school. I always burst out like a bitch, but I\u2019ve got tempermental issues. I just want to die right now. I honestly can\u2019t take life anymore. I sometimes say to myself, \u201cFuck me,\u201d or \u201cWhy do I exist,\u201d etc. But I guess, at one point in time, I might realize that my sadness must of been useless. My old friends (I\u2019m still friends with them, for context) have realized how sad I\u2019ve become; they support me more than my fucking family. My boy best friend literally treats me as if I was his girlfriend, and it is in a good way. Everyone tells me, \u201cWhat are you on?\u201d \u201cOh my god, shut the fuck up,\u201d \u201ctweaker,\u201d \u201cit\u2019s controllable dumbass,\u201d etc. I feel the need that I have to apologize, but for what? I never did anything wrong. I\u2019m only existing. Physically. But not mentally. Sadness is the only thing I feel. I\u2019m living in pain. Awful, shitty memories come back. Every day, I wake up and I just break down crying. Painfully. My life is endangered.. by me. Due to me being in a depressed state, yet again. My parents want to take me to an asylum because I\u2019ve attempted to kill myself and other things. But I guess, pain makes you stronger, right? It does, it tells you how alive you are. Have a good day, if you chose to read this. \u2764",

Plus, the tune is a welcome throwback to \u201cold school\u201d songwriting, with MELODY and nicely woven lyrics.  SO much modern pop is mostly staccato ANTI-melody, to cover for talentless, pitch-corrected singers, who can\u2019t carry a tune in a bucket.  Talent stands out when floating in a sea of mediocrity.",

Nothing lasts forever, I am finally happy again. After a long time. Have faith in tomorrow and if you want my advice believe in God and try socializing. DON'T FORCE SOCIALIZING OR SMILING.. it got worse when i added pressure on myself, but... praying helps and small steps at a time..",

I\u2019m in year 8 and I never felt like I fit in, I\u2019d try and make conversation with someone but they would just leave, it made me feel alone. When I did actually make a friend, it would only last about a month before I stopped talking to them because it wasn\u2019t working out. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s my personality or maybe my looks but the only friends that stuck with me was ones that I made in year 2.

After 20 years I feel like A nobody cause my whole life ive given so much to people cause thats what I was raised to do the right thing and it was never reciprocated.  Not by my husband, my mother, my father, friends. As a woman you are truly unappreciated and its a struggle cause if I make a mistake or bad choices I am the bad one. I struggle understanding how to forgive myself for letting him stay when I was the one who always felt unappreciated.  When I hear this song my heart knows thats exactly how I feel but Im to scared to be happy cause Im scared yo be hurt again ,whether its alone or with my husband.  I could literally just curl up in a ball and just stay there forever cause I\n dont wanna feel anything .",

Wether you parents wanted you or not doesn\u2019t matter. They were just a vessel to bring you into the world. God made you with purpose and with a plan in mind, the amazing thing about him is that he lets us choose whether we want to be part of that plan or not. Today he is giving you an opportunity to start again anything you may have done or anything that may have been done to you, it doesn\u2019t matter anymore. We are all sinners we will never be perfect in our own strength we will always have something missing in our hearts Jesus is the only one that can fill that hole. You are made clean by the power of Jesus Christ\u2019s  death and resurrection he has made us new. Make your choice today he is knocking at the door of your heart. All you have to do is receive him in and let him be the king of your life. trust me, his plans are much better than anything we could ever come up with and I know that from experience.\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764",

Academics, art, dance, sports, debates, inter school competitions, I never lost, always at the top. But I feel like after lockdown, I lost my spark. No matter how hard I try, I can't do anything right. I had my whole life perfectly planned out but now I am not sure about anything. I am not good at anything now. I see other people my age, and all of them seem like they are so happy and fulfilled and organized and just doing great. I don't know who I am or what I want to do in life. I am in 12th grade right now, I hope I get selected in a good good college next year. For now, I just wish things could go back to the way they were.\n\nEDIT: this is the first time I have had to edit my comment.

No parents that care about me, in an emotionally abusive relationship I can\u2019t seem to get out of with 4 kids being involved, have a crappy job, don\u2019t get to spend much time with my kids, finances are stressful, I have no friends, and PTSD with ADD and anxiety/depression makes me really think\u2026 what was I really made for? Sucks being depressed, hearing sad music makes you feel better in the mean time but it builds back up again. \u201cI\u2019m sad again, don\u2019t tell my boyfriend, it\u2019s not what he\u2019s made for\u2026.\u201c\ud83d\udc94",
