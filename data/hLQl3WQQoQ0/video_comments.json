I thought it was her, but i'm not sure, she walked by me and smiled while I was sitting on the bench, she went to the locker room and walked out the front door before I could figure out if it was her or not, she was wearing bright colorful make up and I could not tell 100% if it was Remy or not. Then after that day they played this song on the radio 10 times a day, which is the first time I ever heard it. Can someone please tell me if that was Remy at Get Fitness that day?",

everything only when we control the lower castes people to reduce population then only we become developed nation the excessive population crisis and non implementation of Sterilisation program it need to be implemented from peon to member of parliament by hook or crook in all religions in bharat\nMales who are wasting their precious time from age 21 to 32 years just in preparation of various exams are creating trouble by reproducing and every male must write his surname clearly he belongs to which religion and which caste general category Shudra or Obc\nThis time we all Rajput's and brahmins must unite together call for all Females and males of our community to prevent explosion of population and for resources of india\nThe corruption is at its peak in bharat all the institution is only indulged in corruption from private to govt sectors the gram panchayat to nagar paalika nagar nigam the mayor of Pune jaipur lucknow takes 10 to 20% commission in any project and these lawyers with police and administration and politicians are make loot with unemployment at its peak in bharat\nAll bars and benches are under the one community The Rajputs, Jaats Brahmins and kayastha only real rajputs not those backwards lodhs etc\nPoliticians apart from party making mockery of people they hand in glove with each other across parties and in this bureaucracy, executive and bars and bench are involved\nInside india now the universities just busy in making politicians by making fool to poor and lower class people educated unemployment is on its high I will name the universities Delhi ,awadh, ccs, kanpur, Devi ahilya, jadhavpur ,jaipur, only busy in making politicians by grabbing money from common educated people\nThis is very ugly face of politics in bharat the politicians and their family members are only getting rich and wealthy while common educated people are continuously suffering in bharat\nI will repeatedly raise the issues what all political persons are doing from gram panchayat to parliament of India only nepotism in every field whether legislature executive or judiciary and so called fourth pillar the media and mediahouses running by businesshouses\nthe politicians with bureaucracy executive and judiciary in high courts and supreme courts are blocked by few people from past 75 years and India is suffering of educated unemployment at its peak we are moving towards stagflation with politicians and businessmen who are politicians and their relatives are continuously getting benefitted  explosion of population must be dealt with heavy hand\nThis time world community have to come forward to deal with excessive population of world and the govt in india is repeating again with bjp rest unemployment will remain bcoz politicians are equally corrupt like people made them across all the political parties common people is just a tool nothing more",

        "text": "Little bit of personal connection to this song:\nSo in my middle school, which was 5th through 7th, you were required to have one music class every year for any given semester. And for the example in this story, I'm gonna talk about my 7th grade year in which I had music class first period for the first semester (from August to December). However at the time (and still now haha), our school district had staffing problems when it came to teachers, so my \"music teacher\" for that first period music class was one of the assistant principals from the junior high school (which was 8th and 9th grade). Because of that, we never did any actual music class work. All we did was watch funny cat compilations and sing karaoke in class. It was pretty much like I had another study hall, that's how laxed it was in there. But anyways, I remember there was this girl in my class named Jada who LOVED Adele, and every single day without doubt she would sing this song once so long as she had the chance. And she did it in such a memorable way that everytime I hear this song or think about this song, I hear her voice singing it. I don't even mean to, I was never friends with her and she was never important to me, yet I still just think of those days whenever I hear this song. Shivering in the cold classroom, dreading going to second period math, wishing I was at home right then playing San Andreas. It's a very weird feeling to know when I was young, I only ever wanted for the day to end and for time to pass by. But now that it's happened I want nothing more than to just go back in time to 7th grade and be a kid again.",

It is the second single and final track on the album. The song was inspired by a broken relationship with one's life partner, and lyrically speaks of Adele's coming to terms with it. \r\n\r\n\r\nXL Recordings released the song as the second single from the album on 24 January 2011 (the same day the album was released) in the United Kingdom and on 9 August 2011 in the United States. Accompanied only by a piano in the song (played by co-writer Wilson), Adele sings about the end of the relationship with her ex-partner.",
