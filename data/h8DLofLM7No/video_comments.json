He's so smart that he knows things that I don't know. He's home schooled because he would get too stressed out at regular school in Texas. He loves your songs and he told me that your themes had real meat--weird literary term we devised. I was like, \"ookkaayy.\" He was right. You have real meat = real stuff to say. Thank you so much for being you. You're an inspiration to my son and me. Graditude in abundance: merci beaucoup!",

Here in Lavender Haze we have a giant fish (and Harry's iconic video), mention of the 50s s***(Harry has been seen wearing pearl necklaces - a very common gift choice of the 50s). Also the house theme...we know about Taylor's but surprised when we then have Harry's House.  It pops up so often, wish now I had made a note with each time there was an item or a word or phrase that carried an uncanny similarity or gave me a wiggle in my stomach or heart. A touch of wonder, and reminding. No I'm not supposing any romantic connection, just a mutual respect. But certainly not coincidence. Maybe just a loud \"hello, it's Me kind of nod.\" - and then again maybe nothing at all.",

That character in the that video is same Taylor in this video.  That\u2019s what I think.  I hope this makes sense which it probably doesn\u2019t.",
