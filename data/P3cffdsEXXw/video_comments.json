I don\u2019t think it\u2019s true because I\u2019m pretty sure this song is about sex or something, but they said Golden was about Harry\u2019s younger self so I\u2019m going to write down what I picked up.\n\n\u201cI know you were way too bright for me\u201d - When harry was younger, he was more positive and more happy-go-lucky and more care free. But the following line : \u201cI\u2019m hopeless, broken, so you wait for me in the sky\u201d - Now (back in 2021), Harry is sadder. He feels empty and lost (maybe after a breakup) and so he left his past self behind, or, in the sky.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re so golden\u201d - Harry is saying his past self is \u201cgolden\u201d. Happy, beautiful. But this ties back to the \u201cso you wait for me in the sky\u201d - Harry might be calling himself the sun, or at least, past self. Because the sun is typically considered golden or bright at certain times. And, back in 1D, Louis had a nickname for Harry - Sun.\n\n\u201cI know that you\u2019re scared because hearts get broken\u201d - warning his past self that yes, he will deal with heartbreak and it can be hard or scary to handle. I like to imagine he was talking to his 16 year old self (fetus Harry era), and fetus Harry didn\u2019t have much experience with dating. He dated a boy in school and had a girlfriend before the band but that\u2019s about it (and if you\u2019re a Larry, he was in love with Louis for nearly the whole time being in the band).\n\n\u201cBut I can feel you take a hold. I can feel you take control for who I am and all I\u2019ve ever known. Loving you\u2019s the antidote\u201d - he can feel himself at times become more carefree or happy or childish. It makes him let go temporarily of the struggles he\u2019s dealing with, just feeling like a kid again. Loving himself (fetus Harry) for being like that at one point let\u2019s him feel it more often, therefore it\u2019s the antidote to his broken self.\n\n\u201cI know that you\u2019re scared because I\u2019m so open\u201d - past self, he doesn\u2019t know yet how open he\u2019ll be which could lead him to more struggles, just being vulnerable and transparent. He knows that if his past self knew what he\u2019d be like now, he\u2019d be scared for getting older, having more experience in life that might be bad or scary.\n\nOr, as I said before, it\u2019s about loving someone and having sex (I can feel you take control)",

A split second decision by the other driver and a turn of the steering wheel by a few inches saved me from being crushed by a huge truck at 65mph/105km. I was hospitalized for 8 days and still suffer from physical issues from the accident. It's slow going,  but I'm slowly recovering.....Even though it was the last thing I heard until I regained consciousness, I still love this song and it brings me so much happiness, (although it took time!)\n\nI couldn't listen to it for awhile until I heard Harry sing it live in concert just 10 feet from me, while in the pit. It made me feel so light and happy to hear it and sing it from the top of my lungs with 10,000 other fans. I adore you Harry. \n\nThanks for NOT being the last thing I ever heard!
