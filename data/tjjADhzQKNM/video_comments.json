If a woman gets married and DOESN'T change her last name, that shows disrespect to her husband. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the name \"Onika Tanya Maraj\".\u00a0Most likely the change was made as a result of\u00a0\u00a0from a greedy Business Manager and or Studio, in anticipation of greater recognition and subsequent monetary gain?!",
