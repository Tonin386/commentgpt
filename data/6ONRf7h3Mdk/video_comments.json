As it is written:\n\n\u201cTherefore I will praise you among the Gentiles;\n    I will sing the praises of your name.\u201d[c]\n\n10 Again, it says,\n\n\u201cRejoice, you Gentiles, with his people.\u201d[d]\n\n11 And again,\n\n\u201cPraise the Lord, all you Gentiles;\n    let all the peoples extol him.\u201d[e]\n\n12 And again, Isaiah says,\n\n\u201cThe Root of Jesse will spring up,\n    one who will arise to rule over the nations;\n    in him the Gentiles will hope.\u201d[f]\n\n13 May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.",

We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.\n\n15 (John testified concerning him. He cried out, saying, \u201cThis is the one I spoke about when I said, \u2018He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.\u2019\u201d) 16 Out of his fullness we have all received grace in place of grace already given. 17 For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. 18 No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is himself God and[b] is in closest relationship with the Father, has made him known.",
