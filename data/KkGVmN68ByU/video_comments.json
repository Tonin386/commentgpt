God can stay in my life forever he is a love merciful god rich in love slow to anger he dissent really get anger he gets heartbroken and disappointed I am adam bennett and I Am god fearing its all for god not for me.\nJohn  316 for God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son whoever believes in him will not perish but have everlasting life john \u201cI am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life\u201d (John 8:12) I will follow jesus forever we love jesus more than you guys we love you the king jesus is very alive he has risen conquered the grave worthy is the name jesus he has risen fight with lighting and thunder feel wings of christ.",
