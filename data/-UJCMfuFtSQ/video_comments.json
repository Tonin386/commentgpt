        "text": "I feel like I'm a little late to the comments but even tho I know you wont see this. Harry, this is my favorite song of yours and I was thrilled to see you had a official music video out for it. I wish I could have gone to your tour but I wasn't able to. Trust me tho I have watched all the best scenes from YouTube \ud83d\ude01 you have inspired me when my parents were only putting me down for who I am and what I want to do. I hope you take a good break and get lots of rest. But be back soon cuz I promise you I will be at one of your concerts! You only deserve the best things in life, I'm praying for you always \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb \nKeep killing it out there!",

        "text": "REPENT FOR JESUS CHRIST IS COMING SOON!\n\nLook into your daily life, dig deep once you find out that you possess the characteristic found in Galatians 5:19-21 which are the works of the flesh : adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies, envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like.\n\nREPENT! REPENT! REPENT! REPENT!\nCHANGE YOUR WAYS AND CHARACTERS, CHANGE YOUR ATTITUDE, CHANGE YOUR ACTION, CHANGE YOUR REACTION, CHANGE YOUR WORDS AND UTTERANCES, CHANGE YOUR BEHAVIOR.\n\nYou need to replace those evil and sinful acts with Galatians 5:22-23 which are the fruit of the Spirit, love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law.\n\nCONFESS ALL YOURS SINS EVEN THE HIDDEN ONES UNTO JESUS CHRIST WITH SINCERITY OF HEART. ALSO ASK JESUS TO HELP YOU FORGIVE ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE HURT YOU AND THOSE THAT YOU, YOURSELF HAVE HURT BECAUSE YOU NEED TO BE FORGIVEN FROM ALL YOUR SINS AND SINFUL DESIRES.\n\nREPENTANCE PRAYER:\nLord Jesus Christ, I am a sinner. I need You as my Lord and Saviour. Come into my heart and wash me with your precious blood. Save my soul today, in Jesus's name! Thank you, Lord!\n\nREMEMBER READ THE WORD OF GOD AND ACT UPON WHAT IT SAYS! Acts 20:32; Joshua 1:8 (NIV)\n\nBefore you read the Word of God, Ask the Holy Spirit in prayer to help you read the Word of God. Ask him to cleanse your heart from any unforgiveness , any darkness, any impurity and also from any distractions. Then proceed to ask the Holy Spirit to enlighten your heart to understand the Word of God. And finally, ask him to give you the grace to act upon what you have read.\n\nREAD THE TEN COMMANDMENT AND ACT UPON THEM EXODUS 20:1-17 (NIV)\n01. I am the Lord your God. \n02. you must have no other gods apart from me,you shall not make statues for yourself to worship.\n03. do not use my name in vain.\n04. do not forget to keep the sabbath day for me.\n05. respect your father and your mother.\n06. do not kill anyone.\n07. do not commit adultery.\n08. do not steal.\n09. do not testify falsely against your neighbor. \n10.do not desire anything that belongs to your neighbor.\n\nALSO READ MATTHEW CHAPTER 5,6,7 (NIV) OUR LORD, JESUS CHRIST ENLIGHTEN US ABOUT THE COMMANDMENT AND HOW WE SHOULD BEHAVE AND LIVE OUR DAILY LIFE.\n\nLIVING CHURCH is a church that is empowered by the HOLY SPIRIT and the TRUE LIVING GOD and THE WORD OF GOD. \n\nLIVING CHURCH ON YOUTUBE\n- Official Emmanuel tv\n- The roadmap to Jesus International ministries\n- City of Jesus International Ministry\n- International Revival in New York\n- SCOAN Thessalonica\n- Johnchi ministries\n- Synagogue tv Official\n- The University Of God\n\nThese living churches are few among the ones that I know. But you should confirm from God in prayer. Ask Jesus Christ to reveal a living church where you can go to worship either physically or in distance. \n\nIMPORTANT READ PROVERBS 3:1-35 (NIV) IT IS WISDOM FOR YOUR NEW LIFE IN CHRIST JESUS.\n\nTIPS:\n\u2010 Ask the Holy Spirit to teach you how to pray and fast.\n- Ask the Holy Spirit to empower you.\n- Ask the Holy Spirit to teach you to pray with knowledge and understanding.\n\u2010 Learn to bring Jesus Christ in every decision making, ask for his advice.\n\u2010 Often ask God for his mercy and favor.\n- Learn to give Jesus Christ thanks for all he has done for you, even if you were not aware.\n\u2010 Ask Jesus to teach how to forgive and love others.\n\u2010 Learn to give him praise in every circumstance, either happy or in pain.\n- Often Ask God to deliver you from evil spirits and their attacks.\n\u2010 Anytimes you feel fear or anxiety, or doubts rebuke them with the Word.\n- Tell others about Jesus, save a soul as you are being saved.\n\nMOTTO: WHAT ONE PRAYER CANNOT DO, MORE PRAYER WILL DO THEM. IN YOUR DAILY LIFE ALWAYS PRAY TO GOD.\n\nYOU must know that receiving Jesus Christ in your life will not always be milk and honey. There will be both good and bad times, but because you have Jesus Christ  on your side, fear, worry and anxiety will not overrule you. \n\nAlso, as you are being saved, remember to save others, tell people about Jesus Christ. You can make a small prayer before approaching them\nThis prayer is an example: LORD, I don't want the soul of my neighbor to perish, I have seen him or her live a life of fornication. LORD, as you bring her or him to me, I cannot mock her or him. Who am I to mock her or him, Father give her or him a willing heart, a repentant heart, a heart to change, let her or his soul be changed. let her or his soul be converted, let her or his soul be redeemed.\n\nEven if others reject your Jesus don't give up, at least one person will be saved through you.\n\nYou are welcome in your new life with Christ Jesus. Let your life both open and hidden glorify The True Living God. \n\nALWAYS REMEMBER YOU ARE LOVED BY GOD. GOD BLESS YOU, SHALOM!!.",

I'm not stupid and already checked using my husbands account and another of mine, my comments are invisible, I never get any likes anymore (they give me 1 per day maybe). This is hilarious and super anoying. Anyone can get lots of likes, you just need to comment on popular videos that have just been uploaded recently. I used to get hundreds of likes per week. Now even my  replies to people are hidden. I don't have friends, and have felt su***dal because of this situation. I am Trans and I thought YouTube was supposed to uplift Trans voices?\nI use YouTube to connect and comment to people I admire and follow, for their creativity. Now I can't talk to anyone. I 6 months not one reply. Nobody can reply to a message that's been censored. Now it's like I don't exist, my voice taken. I just want it back, please...YouTube,I'm pretty sure this is ILLEGAL? I never used hate speach, or any of that crap. And this comment will probably be hidden too, that's why I am posting it on multiple super popular videos. It's not fair, I deserve a voice here like everyone else!!!\ud83d\ude20",
