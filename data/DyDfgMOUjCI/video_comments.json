If youre still living in sin listening and worshipping all these celebrities just know you are not with God. You have a choice as you breath God still has mercy on you, you can choose God and salvation. Or Satan and hell once someone dies its heaven or hell. I was a huge fan of karol g, rhianna, eminem, billie eilish, camila cabello, doja cat, harry styles you name it. Until Jesus came into my life, opened my eyes to how evil this world really is and saved me. All celebrities have sold their souls they show it and say it all the time. Satan was in charge of music in heaven before betraying God and the biggest influence in life is music and notice how its all demonic? If youre a unbeliever and a believer who doesnt wanna follow Jesus and His way of life then live your best life because this world is all youre gonna get after its eternal forever pain in torture. Ive experienced hell when i stopped following God for how hard His path was and that traumatized me i choose Life i choose Jesus. If anyone wants to be saved believe in Jesus that He is the son of God and died for your sins and arose on the third day and you shall be saved. The Holy Spirit will be with you to teach, guide, and lead you the way Jesus wants us to live through Him. If a believer wants to be forgiven, REPENT and truly surrender your life to Jesus and let the Holy Spirit lead you to Jesus way of life. In the bible it says YOU CANNOT SERVE TWO MASTERS either youre with God \ud83d\udcaf percent or with the devil.",

You know how videos get recommended most when they were first uploaded? when time passes it slowly get reccomended less and less. That applies to comments too. Somewhere at the bottom of the comment section, The famous \u201cIm the bald guy\u201d comment is there. This makes total sence since a year has passed. To prove myself, you can search the ID of the comment and it is still there. thats for reading all this, and bye.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: im not saying it did but *IF IT EVER* gets deleted it would not be youtube because they sent an award to him for the most liked comment on all of youtube. its also not Seth Everman (sry if i pronounced it wrong) A.K.A. the creator of the comment, did not delete it too for obvious reasons. It could be billie eilish also because she doesnt want the comment to steal attention from the video. bye. (again)",
