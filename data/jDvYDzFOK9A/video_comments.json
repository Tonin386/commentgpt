This has kept me up at night and it makes me question life so much. I don't understand why because of all the woke that this isn't being talked about like all the other famous cases. This was worse than that. They were tiny. Tiny when this started. You remember how small just in body and even soul your kids were and  this Happened when these boys were really young and i dont have any other option i dont have social media i have to ask some one who has a platform to  please help them.  Please look into this and if there is a way we can start a go fund me and you would make sure it would get to the two boys or something. It's made me literally heart sick since I found out about it and I dont know what to do. I cant pay my bills how can I do anything I don't even have a working car for 8 months now I don't have my shit together. I can't not do anything and it's making me ill to not do anything and I don't have social media so I am asking on here . I just cant over this. I can't look Into it any more tho to even know any more then when I first found out . I just am wishing someone who has power and Influence to help even if it's completely not publicly and no one finds out you helped. Please or ask someone you know who can help. And make sure they don't get victimized again.",

Today, I watched this and digest the mv. I just cried. All this time I thought this is a song about someone being in love. I cried because I'm so affected with those little details in mv and all the lyrics. Love yourself everyone. Dont be hard to yourself. \u2764",

I had been trained By the Nuns since Grade 1 & later as one of two soloists with our school.  Great for missing classes, but resented on Sat mornings at 10 am.  Finally your voice cracks at 12 - 14 & you are fired.   But Adelle!!!?? the aforementioned song...Virtuoso Piano But on top of everything - her voice.  Very strong and she is 100% in charge of wherever it goes.  The first Day I heard her I must have played that song 20 - 30 times. Literally mesmerized by her talent as a vocalist...all day.  I called my cousin/sister about her and she said yup, that's her.  She is a trained Classical Pianist and she Praised her playing.  For me, the talent that kicks me in the head is her vocal skill/style.  Breathing easy, phrasing, perfect, melding her Falsetto with her Diaphragm , Just pure, easy, natural skill.  I am grateful to have found her. Thanks for the Beauty, Adelle,  Oh and I love how you sometimes talk like a sailor.  Cheers, you beautiful Gift.",

And this song resonates so much, because I always have to be a different person to make everyone else happy. After a brain aneurysm, surgery in 2013 I technically became a different person, but I live through it. This song is part of a journey and with that journey, calm sadness, love, hope we have to try to be our own authentic selves without pushing ourselves, and what we think is right on other people, and when you have people in your life who don\u2019t except you, they don\u2019t except all of you, and therefore should be excluded from your life. That toxicity hurts your heart hurt. Your soul hurt your love we need to love each other better.\u2764",

Here is a \"UPDATED LIST\" ..The last time voters elected a Republican mayor: Salt Lake City 1972. Chicago 1952. Detroit 1962. Atlanta 1879. Houston 1933.

His muse \"Ophelia\" from William Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\".\n\n\"The episode depicted is not usually seen onstage, as in Shakespeare's text it exists only in Gertrude's description. Out of her mind with grief, Ophelia has been making garlands of wildflowers. She climbs into a willow tree overhanging a brook to dangle some from its branches, and a bough breaks beneath her. She lies in the water singing songs, as if unaware of her danger (\"incapable of her own distress\"). Her clothes, trapping air, have allowed her to temporarily stay afloat (\"Her clothes spread wide, / And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up.\"). But eventually, \"her garments, heavy with their drink, / Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay\" down \"to muddy death\"...\" (Wikipedia, 2023)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophelia_(painting) \n\nThemes of grief.",

But, FFS this hit me like a coal train (freight train for our friends from the t'other side of t'pond) - thank you both @Adele and @TheLateLateShowwithJamesCorden - this song sums up so much, for so many people - for me, this landed at a very opportune time, as we fight childhood leukaemia in the Welsh Marches with my 7yo daughter xx",

        "text": "Wow! After hearing this song, I felt the need to write just something. Coming from the perspective of a middle aged man suffering from Asperger\u2019s, this sums up the last 15yrs of my life. From a young age, where diagnosis wasn\u2019t available, you were just the naughty kid, the kid that got scalded all the time, the kid that was never understood, never fully accepted but yet somehow got through by being someone that wasn\u2019t really me. In my older years it cost me a marriage, leaving two beautiful children, although they stayed true to me, there was always me, being that person I wasn\u2019t that seemed to make it so, in someways me being false. A second marriage and two stepchildren and another daughter, very much feeling blessed, it became apparent that my youngest had some issues, a trait I recognised. My daughter had tests, meetings through years of being excluded by friends and family, through no fault of her own, heartbreaking as a parent and devastating for a child, my daughter. Years later I decided to get myself tested and low and behold, the diagnosis was high function Asperger\u2019s syndrome, this opened up a world of learning, trying to reinvent yourself, which is still going on to this day with many many counselling sessions. My daughter thankfully have received a lot of help, support and guidance, something that is much harder for a man approaching his 60th birthday next year. All in all, if I could have written, in words, how I\u2019ve felt years now, these would have been those words. The one person, the only person who has stood by my daughter and I, is my wife and I truly, truly thank her and I do, ever day, just for understanding, forgiving our moments of madness.  We are trying, we are climbing, to be the people that you deserve to have in your life. To my five children, I love you and if I\u2019ve let you down, I\u2019m trying to be the person I want to be, not the person you may have thought I am\nI have sent this song to my wife, just to say, this is what I\u2019ve been trying to say is going on in my head, but can never find the words to explain. . I JUST WANT TO BE ME !!! Thank you \ud83d\ude22",

Knowing that she wrote this from a conversation with James Corden and he shared that it was regarding work and internet stuff, made me think how it has been affecting him with what everyone shares about him. He is so hated, and I could never fully understand it. And I'm someone that religiously watches his show. And I don't think he gets enough credit for what he has created. During COVID James created magic with his crew and no one speaks about it. We are so easy to break one another down. And this song is from a friend to a friend. Completely getting you and completely validating your feelings. This is magic and their friendship is beautiful.",
