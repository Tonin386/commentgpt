    "description": "Official Video for \"I Drink Wine\" by Adele.\nShop the \"Adele\" collection here: http://shop.adele.com\n \nListen to \"30\" here: https://www.adele.com\n \nFollow Adele:\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/Adele \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/Adele \nInstagram - http://instagram.com/Adele\n \nLyrics\nHow can one become so bounded by choices that somebody else makes?\nHow come we\u2019ve both become a version of a person we don\u2019t even like? \nWe\u2019re in love with the world but the world just wants to bring us down\nBy putting ideas in our heads that corrupt our hearts somehow \nWhen I was a child every single thing could blow my mind\nSoaking it all up for fun but now I only soak up wine\nThey say to play hard you work hard find balance in the sacrifice \nYet I don\u2019t know anybody who\u2019s truly satisfied\n \nYou better believe I\u2019m trying to keep climbing\nBut the higher we climb feels like we\u2019re both none the wiser\n \nSo I hope I learn to get over myself \nStop trying to be somebody else\nSo we can love each other for free\nEverybody wants something, you just want me\n \nWhy am I obsessing about the things I can\u2019t control?\nWhy am I seeking approval from people I don\u2019t even know? \nIn these crazy times I hope to find something I can cling on to \nCause I need some substance in my life\nSomething real, something that feels true\n \nYou better believe for you I\u2019ve cried high tides\nCause I want you so bad but you can\u2019t fight fire with fire \n \nListen I know how low I can go \nI give as good as I get\nYou get the brunt of it all cause you\u2019re all I\u2019ve got left\nOh I hope in time we both will find peace of mind\nSometimes the road less travelled is a road best left behind \n \n#Adele #IDrinkWine #30",
