I already liked this song but the day he confessed that he liked another girl, this song hit differently! I could relate with every single word of this song. It's sick how music can make you feel the same way you felt in that particular moment all over again. It still makes me feel the way it did back then, smth that I don't feel the other times, all the memories come back to me and it feels like I am going through it right now. This song exactly describe how I felt. And I definitely made it \"easier for him to leave me\" and \"loved him either way\"\n.\nP.S. am completely over him now, thanks to my \"bestfriend\" who is in love w me the way I am in with him ;)",

Even if she wanted to breakup first, there were reasons for her to say so, however \nHe says in the song \"we dont have to fix it.. \nwe dont have to stay\" it shows he didnt care about her feelings or that she was hurt or wanted him to be loyal to her. Its not always that a girl says she is leaving and means it. We often say it so we are stopped. Thats all we want. Woman wants to feel needed, he didnt need her. \nHe was passively aggressive in the relationship ever worse - he just didnt care.",
