For that reason I\u2019m glad Beyonc\u00e9 was the one who got to release it officially, she obviously shares drake\u2019s appreciation and interest in dancehall.",

        "text": "100 anni fa\u00a0nasceva a\u00a0Mvezo, un villaggio del Sudafrica,\u00a0Nelson Mandela. Faceva parte della trib\u00f9 di etnia Xhosa, e la sua casa era in una valle fertile del Capo Orientale. La sua famiglia era reale e, nella lingua della sua gente, il suo nome\u00a0Rolihlahla\u00a0significa profeticamente \u201cattaccabrighe\u201d. Nelson \u00e8 invece il nome scelto per lui dall\u2019insegnante del collegio britannico che ha frequentato da ragazzo.\n\nLa sua figura \u00e8\u00a0fondamentale per la storia di tutti noi, fonte di inesauribile\u00a0ispirazione. A lui dobbiamo\u00a0l\u2019abolizione dell\u2019apartheid in Sudafrica, perch\u00e9 fu Madiba a lottare contro\u00a0razzismo,\u00a0disuguaglianza\u00a0e\u00a0povert\u00e0. Per questo pass\u00f2\u00a027 lunghi anni in prigione, per la sua resistenza al regime segregazionista sudafricano. Venne liberato nel 1990 e nel\u00a01994\u00a0divent\u00f2\u00a0Presidente\u00a0del Sudafrica nelle prime elezioni a\u00a0suffragio universale.\n\nIn carcere, era carcere duro di totale isolamento, Madiba\u00a0non ha mai perso la speranza\u00a0e si \u00e8 dichiarato disposto a morire per ci\u00f2 in cui credeva, ovvero una societ\u00e0 giusta ed equa. E disse, infatti, al processo, con un\u2019appassionata arringa di quattro ore:\u00a0Ho nutrito l\u2019ideale di una societ\u00e0 libera e democratica, in cui tutte le persone vivono insieme in armonia\u2026 Questo \u00e8 un ideale per cui vivo e che spero di realizzare. Ma se \u00e8 necessario, \u00e8 un\u2019ideale per il quale sono pronto a morire.\n\nEcco 10 sue frasi da portare sempre con s\u00e9, per ricordarlo. E ricordare.\n\n1.\nLa tua libert\u00e0 e la mia non possono essere divise. Non puoi dividere la libert\u00e0.\n\n2.\nUna buona testa ed un buon cuore sono sempre una formidabile combinazione\n\n3.\nL\u2019educazione \u00e8 l\u2019arma pi\u00f9 potente che si pu\u00f2 usare per cambiare il mondo.\n\n4.\nLa morte \u00e8 inevitabile. Quando un uomo ha compiuto quello che ritiene essere il suo dovere nei confronti della sua gente e del suo Paese, pu\u00f2 riposare in pace. Penso di essermi impegnato in tal senso ed \u00e8 per questo che potr\u00f2 dormire sereno per l\u2019eternit\u00e0.\n\n5.\nSembra sempre impossibile finch\u00e9 non lo hai fatto.\n\n6.\nLe persone coraggiose non hanno paura di perdonare, per il bene della pace.\n\n7.\nEssere liberi non significa solo sbarazzarsi delle proprie catene, ma vivere in un modo che rispetta e valorizza la libert\u00e0 degli altri.\n\n8.\nDobbiamo usare saggiamente il tempo e capire che i tempi sono\u00a0 sempre maturi per fare la cosa giusta.\n\n9.\nLa nostra compassione umana ci lega l\u2019uno all\u2019altro , non per piet\u00e0 o condiscendenza, ma come esseri umani che hanno imparato a trasformare la sofferenza comune in speranza per il futuro.\n\n10.\nNoi siamo nati per testimoniare la gloria di Dio dentro di noi. Non soltanto in qualcuno, ma in ognuno di noi. Nel momento in cui noi permettiamo alla nostra luce di splender, noi inconsciamente diamo agli altri il permesso di fare lo stesso. Nel momento in cui noi siamo liberi dalla nostra paura, la nostra presenza stessa, automaticamente\n\n Non lo fregate voi come non fregate la signora cieca domani e mercoled\u00ec alla Asl o pulizie agenda",

Beyonce either lost her soul to the illuminati or this is a cry to help for help to escape the illuminati. I know that the bar for pop music has been lowered every year but there used to be a bar that the superstars set. The beat is watered down and boring and doesn't change, the vocals are flat and have no emotion and that rap at the end is cringe inducing. I haven't heard vomit inducing music since old town road and the two songs are earily similar in that the lyrics were probably stolen from a poetry class taught by a teacher with down syndrome but it also has no melody and a 2 dollar beat from K mart. All in all if I hadn't been alive to hear Beyonce have talent I wouldn't believe it.",

I\u2019m very much more than enough. My style is unique, my aura is golden, my presence is revered, your replacement of me is cheap. It\u2019s embarrassing. For your, not for me. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong to recognize that. But, nobody will ever conduce me believing myself less than. Ever. Rise up to the occasion, please.  Or don\u2019t, but I will continue to be the coolest motherfucker you ever met. Fuck your validation.",
