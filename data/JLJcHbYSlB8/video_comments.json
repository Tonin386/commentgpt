All of these pop songs have similar rhythm nowadays.",

Eg: Weekends save your tears and die for u\nExhibit C: Olivia rodrigo is accused of sampling cruel summer for deja vu and recieves hate for copyright blah blah sparking rumors that taylor and olivia are not on good terms anymore. \nMy take: A fan can never get mad at their idol and judging from the no. of videos of olivia stanning Taylor online we can conclude    she's a die hard fan. Also  why would taylor be mad at olivia??Olivia was the one who chose to give taylor writing credits. Taylor knows Olivia is a diehard swiftie\n\nSolution: Taylor drops cruel summer feat Olivia rodrigo sending that song #1 and absolving all doubts about this mother-daughter pair. Olivia is the MOST perfect candidate for this feature because of the fan theories \ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc9c",
