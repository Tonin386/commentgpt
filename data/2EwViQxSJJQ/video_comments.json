What if this were symbolic of ABBA Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit singing about your relationship and unfaithfulness to them? And God is saying I\u2019m marking you as \u201cgoats on the left\u201d. Lol I bet y\u2019all would change your tune like no God give me another year, when God gave you 2-3 extra years to get your relationship on track.\n\n\u201cWhen the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: and before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: for I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee? Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me. And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.\u201d\n\u202d\u202dMatthew\u202c \u202d25\u202c:\u202d31\u202c-\u202d33\u202c, \u202d41\u202c-\u202d46\u202c \u202dKJV\u202c\u202c https://bible.com/bible/1/mat.25.31-46.KJV",
