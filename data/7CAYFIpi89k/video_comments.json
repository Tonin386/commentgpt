Sell myself to these leeches and become empty and shallow. or . be alone and then inevitably go mad. or perhaps there's a third option. one that addresses these issues. I hope I find it or someone helps me before it's too late and I do something that ruins me. Does anyone understand. even a little?",

        "text": "I remember when I was 11-12 I was laughing about depression, sadness and loneliness. Now I'm 17 and have literally no friends. I hate my life, I hate waking up everyday just to go to school and see all the people just laughing and having good time. When I sit in class I hear ppl talking about party that was last weekend, how fun it was. Just behind my back. It seems like universe hates me because every fucking time I try to change my life nothing is happening. The harder I try, the worse results are. I feel like if I have disappeared no one, except my family, would care. No one wants to hang out with me. If you have a real friend, appriciate the fuck out of them. Seems like a simple thing but some people can't have even them. I'll probably spent my 18th birthday alone.\nI'm devastated.\nIf god exists he's a fucking psycho",

Because you're out there on the road seeing other people who are looking to fight the loneliness in their lives.\nThey are trying to commune with their fellow countrymen and women.\nI used to do this when I had a new car and ventured out into southern New Mexico, stopping in at recommended roadside restaurants in small towns along the way for some great food.\nBut that loneliness never goes completely away when you see it in the faces of the people around you. America. What a country.",

It's a beautiful song, in many ways, and I think everyone has felt this way at least once in their lives. He really captures the feelings and the motions you go through just to try to CONVINCE the world, and more importantly, YOURSELF-- that everything is okay-- when that couldn't be farther from the truth. But you HAVE to be convincing. You have to be the reluctant actor. You have to play pretend so well that even you, the playwright of this entire production, the only one who truly knows what's behind the curtain, can still believe it even just a little... So you can keep going. So you can say, with conviction, \"everything is okay.\" Yes, don't worry, everything is okay. \"Smile all the time.\" Hey, it's okay. I'm fine. \"Laugh at every joke.\" \u00a0I am okay. I promise. \"Shine your teeth 'til meaningless.\" ...Can't you see, clearly I must be alright? You can't look through me if I turn myself to stone. ...Don't let them see you crumbling. Nobody can break this condemned tower down but you. Total catharsis. And then you rebuild-- You rebuild the fuck out of that tower, you make that tower grow into a castle, and it emerges more beautiful and full of life and meaning than it has ever had before. And then? You really ARE okay.",

Car in back has been chasing the car in front for the longest time, gets close to it, then once again slips back. No feeling more lonely than that. Car in back catches up to the car in front again...and finally decides to pass it and move on. That's how you fight loneliness.",
