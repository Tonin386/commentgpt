No I.d's and people thinking they can just walk on anyone's hard work and an ungrateful wife! What's the point of art when people suffer! Maybe she can sell me somore lie's! Second best unless your selling, and selling is illegal unless you have a licence! When is the next gesture calling the shots! Thier onto somthing else until they get tired or trying to hustle and manipulate what's not thiers! Wow! I don't want people living rent free inside my head or my buisness! Better yet I'm anyoed with people messing with my life anf grateful for the artists! Why the attacks?",
