I'm just gonna say that Dua Lipa is BY FAR the best modern pop singer. Her music sounds like it could be from the 70s, 80s, or 90s. It's classic pop music, not the cold, robotic stuff that dominates the airwaves these days. Her music has soul and it's damn catchy. I'm glad she's around.",

The music video adds to the amusement though I admit that I find the scenes where she is on the airplane and dancing with the models/dancers dressed in flight attendant inspired costumes enhance the imagery effect of the theme of the euphoric andor rollercoaster type of emotions that the music narrator is feeling.",
