I thought everyone should know. We are imprisoned in a place whose slogan was freedom.\u00a0 Don't travel to the USA. Never even for a short time. If you have any special knowledge or skills or an invention, they will steal it from your mind. The US government initially used this method to identify people who intended to harm the United States. But today, they use it for many purposes, including stealing information from people and stealing data from people's minds. Many celebrities like Taylor Swift and Harry Styles are helping to lure the US government. They can see whatever you see. You'll never have privacy even with your wife or girlfriend.\u00a0They could see whatever you think. When Taylor Swift said I used my best colors for your portrait, she meant it. when she said, \"Touch me, and you'll never be\u00a0 alone.\" Or I can read you like a magazine.\u00a0 Your silence would help them to do it again and again. They said, \"Don't say anything because of the USA. I want to take her to court. They wanted to pay me $1,000,000, but that was not the amount that I asked them for. Those are not only songs (Taylor Swift) likes A writer of crime stories whose stories are authentic and have committed all the murders. Taylor Adolf Hitler, the Humans, are not your laboratory mice. Sometimes, what we hear is like warning lights to prevent accidents.
