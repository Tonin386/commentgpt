I love listening and seeing it combined with scenes from the movie, and more while Simba returns and faces his past.. I really felt the power and the message: each letter moves me and awakes up something inside me; that's why it was extraordinary for the movie because it better reflects the Simba's path and fight towards his destiny (to says: A BOY BECOMES A MAN) .. From minute 2:35 the song becomes more EPIC and EXCITING: I love the chorus and all the lyrics when it says: Spirit ,watch the heavens open, can you hear it callin', your destiny is comin' close, stand up and fight and be one with The Great I am, a boy becomes a man.. I don't know what emotion my heart feels with this song.. I love how represent the wonders and charms of the landscapes of Africa",

I was inspired. I AM inspired. I WILL always be inspired.\n\nThank you Beyonc\u00e9.

And or not yet making really cool introverted things outside. Inside of \nsociety but yet outside of your home. There are some ambiverts who could help you with\nthat. \"Focus on your focus.

You don't settle for the ghost of you so that the taurus \nthat comes after the Pisces, Aries Taurus combo. Doesnt have to feel\nalienated because there will be room for them to be a person within society.\nAnd as such you won't have to work far outside of your limits in regards// terms \nof health and safety. I almost made friends with Kiana. She threw all the tables \naround people would hold her down in there arms. There wasnt yet enough room \nfor her to naturally be a kid unchiselled apart just naturally her within society.

And then\neat your whole foods, like steak, chicken \nbreast, salmon, heavy cream, water, etc\nso that you have enough like protein like \nfoods in your stomach like a polar bear \nstoring up for hibernation in their dens \nduring the winter time. Hibernation for \nhumans that deep deep deep sleep where \nyou can rest your soul. And really think about\nstuff. Without possibly dying if you eat right \nbefore hand. Also for the body eat your fibre. \nLow and slow and you might just learn something \nabout yourself. And some food for thought too. \nFood for the brain to help you think. Like yeast in \nthe pure water. You just need a little bit of sweetness.\nAnd theen youre off. Ready to proof your let the yeast\nof thoughts rise. And then kneading the dough.  Umm I\ndon't know what that one is called yet. And then muffins\nin the oven season. 0,3,6,9,12. \"A goal without a deadline \nis just a wish\" -- Pinterest. As well as preheat your oven \nto 350 or whatever. Same with your environments, from time \nto time. I guess. And then take them out when you are ready and\nlet them cool.

It can lose some of its magic. But still work as the main function of a physical door. But physical and or magical the sliver on its down doesnt do much. Focus on doing what makes you happy! Focus on falling in love feeding your passions interest and hobbies. Don't worry too too much about love. Focus more on the health and safety. Don't have a dear walk into your Fxxk'N living room because you didnt have a door there. All waiting and or leaning only on love. Staying true to you (Your passions, interest and hobbies and feeding those healthy hobbies in a healthy way) is how you can also grow through the pain; too.",

        "text": "\"Rejoice in the truth and not the chaos\" -- tHB. It looks like period blood. \"Do no embrace ignorance\" -- tHB. Low Iron, Anemia is real. Eat steak. To avoid cramps. Rest. Hydrate. Eat bread. And or fruit. \"For it is not the letter of the law, but the fulfilment of the law\" -- Jesus debating the Pharises. Watch how to menstrate and what it means. I know it sounds girlie. But listen to me. Hear me out. You need that pure water for your heart, when your heart is bleeding. Maybe your heart is supposed to shed like a uterus every month. Its not a girl or guy thing. It may just be a scorpio, Taurus thing. The leaves die quickly in the Fall (Ball) time. And the leaves grow slowly in the spring. So when you over grow an environment you need to know when to leave. Know when and or where to go. Big fish in a little pond to a little fish in a big ocean. Its just when it is time to move on. That or when it is time to spring (forward). I overheat during that season. I need popsicles to cool me down. Blanket to keep me warm. Opened window to let some fresh air in. Although Im always puking my guts out first day. That I still dont get why? I know that part is not normal. It fxxk'N hurts. But look up how to menstrate and then translate it to the fulfilment of the law. I dont yet know what a popsicle for the soul and or spirit is for the fulfilment; yet. I dont know yet but you need a healthy and safe space to deal with the aftermath that can bring you back. The spring forward is a team effort. Based on truth. Monthlys for me can get so painful I have to take a few days off. I usually stock up ahead of time with water, popsicles, orange juice, I usually can't really keep anything for the first two to three days. Its sooo fxxk'N painful. But I learned about how polar pears hibernate in the north pole. And the importance of eating proteins when lifting weights. The heart is a muscle. Testing the weight before you lift when working retail. Broken heart syndrome or just low iron. Try and eat a steak. Get a blood test. You can see anemia on an ECG. Too many High School nights doing math homework in the ER. Thinking I was a frequent flying. Medical term when you just want attention when I refused to accepted the fxxked up situation of heavy heavy pain as normal. I dont numb my pain. Painkillers cannot give you iron needed to help with the anemia which gives you heavy heavy period pains. It can only numb the problem. And that shit adds up years later. It took 4 years. And Im still recovering. Its better but I worry about the one who still numb there problems. I learned about the importance of the Fruits of the spirit (Choir Sunday Song Service). And the importance of ventilation during the fermenting process. For when putting pure water to holy wine. \nAnd the importance of Vegetables for the soul (The Sermon// the preacher preaching). Truth I think. 1:28 Yellow Tape by cHRIS bROWN. Heartbreak on a full moon. Based on truths. How do you keep someones truth. Hide the truth from them? Change based on a pendulum swing maybe? If we get in trouble for speaking truth in society? For speaking up in society? Asking questions and or speaking up within society? You don't think that we are then keeping ourselves in these self impose prisons. Are we not maintain // accepting the brainwashing imposed by society. Stormi Webster saying Patience in order to not eat the candy while Kylie recorded it. She's doing clinical trials on her kid. Psychologically manipulating her kid. Rather then fighting for her own inner child. Look at her childhood versus her kids. And then that's who ends up leading the souls. And being in charge of the vegetables of the souls. \"How its made?\" -- MWJ. You need to go out into the ocean. If you cannot yet. Find healthy and safe spaces to ventilate. Lay down in green pastures. Speak truth when and where you can. Live truth. 4 lefts and you can go full circle. Especially in your own environment. All that pure water can drown the spider and the web of lies. But are you just trying to get truth? And or truth for ventilation?\nAnd or then truth for solutions? I find it easier to number crunch Algebra, after I have all the variables. But that being said \"A little bit of righteousness over a lot with strife\" -- tHB. I'll give truths when and where I can. Truth for truth, ventilation and or solutions when and where I can. I had to wait for this album to ferment for me. These albums actually. I like reading the series after It has all come out. I dont wanna be left on a cliff hanger. So I try and focus on what Im doing before hand. Stock up until Im ready. Like saving up episodes on your PVR until youre later ready to NETFLIX a series. Batch content. Batch viewing. Everyone knows that watching a new series is better when there are already a few seasons loaded. ..... Right ???? Same with fermented vegetables of the soul. Youve got to wait for the water to stock up in the bucket before you try to pour it. \"Do not ye be too eager to gain\" -- tHB. But go before youre ready. \"Do not embrace ignorance\" -- tHB. \"Be busy like the wise ant\" -- tHB. I hope this helps. Think where else is there blood in the body? Blood lost in the body? Where else are there muscles in the body? Where else in society do you lift things? You need a healthy and safe space to deal with the aftermath? You dont wanna be in the streets feeling sickly? And when youre honest with you you can easier see the fake ass ones. Even on an off day. Honest to you. Helps you. Tamar was Raped in the hOLY bIBLE, by her brother. Jonadabs play. Her brother pretended to be sick. Got her to come after he sent everyone out. And then bait and switched up on her. Raped her adn then sent her on her way. She left and then she Ashened herself. Took her colors off. If you know what you wont do when youre sick. When youre healthy it'll be easier to see the fakes. Why would you ever park you car on the other side of the parking lot? On a normal day? And if you were sick? Have you ever been sick? What about sick sick? Nahh you'd stock up? You'd feeling your body getting weird? Monthly well' the pattern is in the name. The power of habit book inspo. You'd know it was coming and stock up then. So you can call out the predator even better. Critical and strategic thinking. Common Sense. Hansel and Gretal. We just found real soul food. WE just found real vegetables of the soul. If you were to hibernate before this you might have actually died. Tough times. \"To thine own self be true\" --Shakespeare's Hamlet. Best, X. Inn Jesus Name, Amen.",

Also - Disney made a mistake by making the Lion King into an emotionless 3D version of the 1994 film. I just realised how POWERFUL this would have been if Disney rather opted to make an adaption of The Lion King with actual people. A tribal sort of musical movie. With real people and emotions and this kind of music and these sun-shots. OH MY SOUL. Disney has probably missed THE MOST EPIC movie remake, they could have ever made. Even though us Millenials has seen the movie over and over and over.",

You just have a look by the side of your face, ooooooh my god. This look alone gave me strength to face all the low self esteem I was facing in my bad relationships and school failure and mental illness. Your fierceness made me feel, \"as long as Beyonce looks this look, I will conquer the world\". I ended all my unhealthy relationships. I finished school (I studied Medicine). And I am recovering from my Bipolar. All just because of how I saw your look and fierceness. I don't know how to explain it to you, but you are cute and beautiful and kind and humble and strong and your voice is unbelievable and your dance moves can turn the whole earth dancing, combine all that and give me the fierce look, then It becomes a piece of cake for me to conquer not just the world, but my inner demons. Thank you for being Beyonce. I know you are a mam now. Just enjoy your life. You deserve all the best. You have done a great job. Relax and enjoy.",
