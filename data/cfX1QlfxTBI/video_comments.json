You don't even believe in Christ\nWhat you sayin' wallahi for? You ain't been on your deen, you've been eating swine, nah\nI ain't the man of your dreams, now you wish that you stayed with your previous guy\nIt used to be 3.5s, now I can sell out the O2 arena twice\nDon't ask what the fee looks like\nDon't believe all the media hype, like eighty percent of these people lyin'\nWho can I ask when I need advice?\nI gotta work hard, it's me who provides\nEmail YBeeez for the feature\nLook, what goes up must come down\nSo when you're in the air, prepare for the landin'\nI did everything that I could for my hood, so how do they say I don't care for the mandem?\nCrib so big I might get out of breath if I walk too quick up the stairs in the mansion\nThey weren't there for the action\nTryna round up three hundred Spartans, we going to war but we ain't in Athens\nEverything won't go to plan, that's not how it goes, I'm afraid shit happens\nRap boy on a footballer's wage, I'm on the same pay as the players at Dallas\nWhat's making the haters jealous? I'm thinking the AP's eighteen karats\nThey call me my government name in Harrods (uh)\nThis one ratchet, don't even know who her baby dad is (nah)\nIf I cum inside, then I won't leave 'til I see her take the tablet (nah)\nHe mention my name 'cause he wanted some fame and he ain't established (huh)\nAlright, you know the verse gon' hit when you hear that adlib\nCome a long way, I was sellin' them opium on my lonely, but I'm not Ken Carson\nI'm a hood red hot, red dot on my head, in my hood I'm a target\nSo driver, stay in the whip while I jump out quick, don't park it\nI can lean out the window and horn it, I'm on the same pay as the players at Charlotte\nBig fish in this ting, no armbands like a back stroke how I swim in that shark tank\nDrop me in the jungle, tree-to-tree, start swingin' like Tarzan\nTwenty-four inch on the rims on the Benz, I'm doing donuts and skidding on tarmac (huh)\nSick of these high-rise buildings, flip the script, now I'm living on farmland (huh)\n\nHmm, grr\nAlright\nAlright",
