We were classmates, barely talked, but through a play, she really made me fall and through then we started chatting up until to this point, she brought out my hidden feelings of love, joy, and a different hue of sadness when i dont talk to her, a picture of us were taken when we were about to dance and whenever that feeling of sadness comes out, i look at the photograph taken of us, and somewhat my loneliness disappears and transforms to hope. She's someone very special to me, and i hope that as time continues, she wants to be with me and give the same feelings i have now for her. Yes, i think a loving teen who thinks he met the right person at a young age and wanna be together forever is cringe, but if this is love, then im glad to experience it.",

And i still can't get over it, because listening to this song helps me to remember and to come back where i had started from, i missed my bestfriend so much. She's my home, but she left me. We're doing our seperate ways right now and i don't know when will she ever remember me. I already visited a lot of mv in yt it's all of my favorite songs. I put down a comment so that maybe she'll notice me here, i think I'm sick. And dying, and no one knows that yet, I'm doing my best trying to keep up and just being ok, but I can't help being sad. But now i know it's part of life that when it's done, it's done. I want to move on from her my family. I don't have a past relationships or until now, I've been single but been to dating before, but I'm not that interested in love. How can i love someone when I can't fix myself? I'm just thankful that some people like Ed Sheeran had come up with such beautiful music! Thank you.",
