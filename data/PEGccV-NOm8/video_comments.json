Brand management is about defining elements as branding choices and brand decisions are about identifying structures within the definition, and then being imagined as an impression, such as what a logo actually represents in the replica of the world economy. The brand is invisible to the phenomenon that may or may not be entirely a reality or constricted as a definition. The defining theme is a mistake and hated the most by science. Images represent informal structure and reality, obviously represent formal elements because there is arguably more than one brand that is competing for noble approval or what is effort to the disabled. A brand positions itself to win in an identity of knowledge, not in a network of data. This means that technology still has room to grow, and the purpose of branding may not fit within the (P-L-O-C) function; planning, leading, organizing, and controlling. What is best for management and more specifically branding in this day and age, is timeless principles of business, administration, and a new form of art. Brand reality is a problem in business culture; this is but limited to the society, which is a solution to the administrative evidence. We need evident appeals to logic so that people can make decisions for the disciple, whoever he may be, he must lead the community he is born to manage. A brand is not promised to prove one is guilty of democracy, yet it is democratic behavior and our current votes and the policy of a new type of voting system that is relative to its determining order that spells the behavior out for hopefully all of us to see. A brand perspective is where I envision the global residence to live, but I know that more clarifying processes are in place, and contingent along the way. What is one way that you see this mission relevant to friendship in online celebrations, such as a forum that replenishes the fossilized evidence of freedom in objective congruency? The lack of a financial education, it has been argued by the unknown writer, is the greatest problem of our time only because the greatest solution is known to be the first, amongst everyone, in everything he writes. Do you personally desire social innovation, or to be first in how a world without competition is competitive to know the difference, or perhaps knowledgeable in how media produces what we follow to tradition, and our experiences expects the exception to be what stubborn agenda we abide by leads us to knowing the way?",

        "text": "The President of The United States is in danger because he should not be reelected. His people have dramatically participated in shaping the nature and effects of the historical American story:that the republican justice stands by peace and happiness and the democratic law stands by order and joy. The pursuit of conservative ideals and liberal reality is comforting to the education that undermines the unknown, but after a true religion is revealed, then one can speak his destiny into the moral fabric whereby he will not be afraid of the future. What we see in the cia is a conflict of interest from the reality of its past (George W. Bush) to the idea of its present condition. The Director of the CIA is faced with an ample amount of challenges, many of which are sovereign in element. He has to decide whether to keep the cia in order by protecting the overwhelming system or he has to become the greatest lawyer ever, who uses his discretion to magnify tradition while at the same time enhancing the picture for a more engaged, and prosperious mission. The evidence is clear, the Director of The CIA reports to the President regarding the unspoken norms that are prevalent in the CIA, but in so doing he neglects the CIA'S Republic Power, which inevitably relies on the contingency of his position. This means that the President is admittedly threatened consistently because he has no direct or indirect intelligence briefing, he only assumes wisdom as truth that is evident, but his calling is what I argue, a more prophetic one. When we report intelligence activity equaly, that is when we will be able to come up with a plan that remains true to our national security responsibilities. We will have to redefine America, but to do this demands the recruitment and acquisition of brilliant talent and the sense that the candidate source, agent, officer, or asset sets a new standard for meeting the process of supporting presidential interest. As one who holds the highest office in the land, it may be to the cia's benefit to protect what is evident by foreign intelligence: that visible ethic revealed as compssion for those individuals who are mentally ill and who are charged and convicted for making presidential assassination threats againsts our countries most political leader, that such analysis reflects beauty into the cia's transformative experience, and breads the birth of quality, fruit that finds the cia innocent of its past, so as to evolve, the president needs clarity for what he has already predicted and proved is vital to those who make such threats. Indeed, it is our commander in chief that must articulate a new and improved era, one that is substantial to how we report and protect our assets. This is business because the economy by default becomes a compelling narrative. I have demonstrated that the president is not protected not because a lack of adequate reporting, although impactful, the problem persists. The president must order the republic power, that is the cia, to implement a new rule that says that law and justice exerts morality and justice without rule is the ideal candidate; that peace comes in phases that transform experiencial identity, that means probative weight is no longer a federal rule to the provision of the process, that we hold wealth to be and political judgment to understand. Thus, a political offense is then a constitutionally protected privilege, if only for the purposes of restoring sovereign right back to its magnified energy, the master caters to the slave, in the same way that law meets justice, people who threaten president's as I did, shall only be accountable to one response, that his intiation will remain forever a secret, that humility will engender understanding, and that law will be seen as responsible,yet not effective to change the transitory function or nature itself of society and or culture. With this understanding, change will undoubtedly occur because we will all be able to see the value in how we come to learn adaptive products of imagination meanadoring the test and realizing love, we will, i conclude this report, in the hope that presidents can invent, that they can regard and respect their character as one with the persons who challenge virtue, that inequality is an inequity of liability, it has no balance, but in a world that we are commanded by Yahshua not to love or even for that matter, be apart of, we see the people that this nation defends. The order is for military service because it selects dynamism in enthusiastic style. It is a creative conversation that America is long past due. Time management is essential to the president's conflict, but adopting my system serves what i believe is any president's goal. The president and not the cia will see the equality that his or her character knows is inexplicably linked to a network of mutuality, like Martin Luther King Jr. dreamed to see only the truth that is possible to know the truth as possibly a probable innovation. The cia will remain a republic power. A Republic power may not be elected by the general citizenry, but this is ok, what duty does the cia report and advise if not the entitled marvel and attraction. The flag stands with the republican vote, yet democracy in capital markets is on its way and still on its way for us to see Martin Luther kings dream realized by not judging character, see truth for what it forgets, the element in the story shapes our return to a point of view that knows no worry about what tomorrow will come to understand. And to be understood by not being judge by the color of our skin, like the prophetic leader spoke, but by the content of what our character finds is potential to the created relationship that justifies everything that i said in this report, including our character.\n\nBy: Lorenzo Maurice Davis\n\nCounter-intelligence specialist against Lucifer, the one who made the earth and nations to tremble.\n\nThe reason love exist is to overcome but the reason love exists is to conquer in how we become.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Onsb_sMNpAE?si=S7QJ3k5j5kGwHxAS",

        "text": "The genealogical research is created to monitor the logic that builds community and generates a rational law for being reflectively analytical, which point to what could be considered a merry-go-round experience that has yet to provide the answer to an antiquated question or to the study of academic interests and how it perceives value in antiquity. You can't store information because web genealogical technology undergoes a formal and informal process, it constructs relationship in evidence  of tracking an earned legacy that is by all definition not related to ones family history, but contemporary uses of data remains credible and strong while it, exists independently and exemplifies a lack of quality subjective feedback and knowledge. web genealogical technology refers to the use of web-based tools only in the sense that they make sense of the hierarchy pyramid that allows the scientific and technological world to adapt, revise, and plan for a future web service that maximizes it's custom product in order to profit in an atomic reality, such processes minimizes the social intent, creating interaction user-friendly organizations that are stable and incoperated by-products to piercing the genetic veil that unfortunately allows tracing mechanisms within the mechanical absent composition and inputing, thus regressing the model framework that launched the reason for rational truth by experimenting with the measurements around the convenience, prevalence, and proximity of space and time, realizing Mr. and Ms. Genet (my business) vision of decisions being acquitted for the sake of a decision being decided without the aid of self, but esteem to be highly privileged accepted, neglected, and debated as a pretigious element within and because of itself, for itself existing as a digital handprint, and foot equals the quantity in creation to live and survive as a pretigious honor that doesn't, as is the case with web servers versus web tools, base itself in isolation, and reside in a domesticated focus, but discerns merit from the product of it's memorial, that is it's family tree and web intimate goods, including the good will that the environment served to protect.\n\nAccording to Google, \"Web genealogical technology refers to the use of technology to research and trace family history'. This definition is misleading because technology and genealogy together make up the study of historical order, and there is no discipline yet to be created that archaeology and anthropology described in their paradoxical mission. This means that Web-Based tools are created to be witnesses about the future design of a genealogical finding that is economically unique with respect to the creativity of the personal and social narrative, meaning that all research into the promising service is dependent upon the independent integrity of the account. I say this because our current understanding of our ancestral link is a historical one, but we are not aware of the relevant facts that shape our society and our culture. Scientists tend to look at the relative sources of remnant discoveries and digital antiquity--thus, they use deductive reason as a method to enable an atmospheric mark on searches and significant impact to dynamic causes. This approach promotes the interests of scientific research and education while being conservative about one's individual duty to present thorough information to one's social circle and contribute to a community of ethical identity; all the more liberal in nature to never account for bias as a fact in personality; to generate wealth means that doubt, (even if it is created, and social scientists are considered to be liars), must be criticized and if an unidentified order exists, then such order must eliminate any element of prediction or conditional consequences, by repeating behavior, archeology and anthropology believe, we can assist the brain with how it adapts to pressure, interacts with sensate reality and view all perceptions as utilitarian in element, which creates destruction in whoever created and made life, but it leaves research as a science, autonomous because we experience more than hope--making relevant use of the remnant of information that we know, inspires learning and doesn't fail to acknowledge the inspiration, which could be a new invention; however, we believe that truth is known by the knowledge that is accurately represented and is a Web-server ruler that the future will one day be forced to see. The only problem is that reality submits to truth not in what it will see, like the discipline of archaeology and anthropology contest, but in what it has already seen and saw, absent of external influence. With that said, everything that I have said up to this point is meaningless. Logic is not logic is the higher truth of my company's higher investigation. \nGenealogy software lets you build your family tree and record relevant information about your ancestors. We need a new architect that exists in an environment of success and finds his own challenge warranted by a new kind of software application--that tools will only be required when one is able and capable of matching what he experiences with, and this is limited, but a responsibility because it is based on economic choice and financial literacy, to produce the equivalent existent opportunity that unifies a preferred network while making use of the unique identifying web-server.  This includes dates, locations, relationships, and others. You can also take note of your research sources and even link them to the family tree that you have created. You can keep multiple databases for numerous family trees. You may also print out your ancestral charts and family tree or share them with other people electronically. Additionally, you can store your photos as well as audio and video records along with scanned documents related to your ancestors. The dillemma is only real in appearance and the web does not have the same inalienable source as a computer without the Internet. The software also has a backup feature, so you can keep your information protected as it assists you by providing tips on how and where to search. Searching ancestral data is the by-product of a mini-invention within GeneWeb, a landmark visitor-based relationship that is based primarily on magic, which sets the standard science for data-based communication restructuring artificial intelligence, leviathan perceptions that are restored in memory, both real and imagined, which results in a new web or a new web technology which grounds existing fictious creations with hard facts that can be tangible in nature, but as of yet, GeneWeb has not produced a new type of tool that justifies equality as it is perhaps evolvingly thought or perceived. GeneWeb is a free multi-platform genealogy software tool created and owned by Daniel de Rauglaudre of INRIA. GeneWeb is accessed by a Web browser, either off-line or as a server in a Web environment. The problem with GeneWeb is that it is an ideological concept, not a theory and it is not creative in the sense that it is in itself not a reliable or credible development because it is not an invention. Lorenzo Maurice Davis invented a new channel. This truth is not contingent or adequately representative of a definition in or about anything in or around existence. What we know now is that love exists. How we become owners of realestate into this highly complex area is that we don't see the field as a force, but rather an influence in the world of decisions; thus, this system is not defined, but it in itself, is special because it assumes that it is the only person qualified to identify.",

        "text": "WebB Genealogical Technology as Lorenzo, the inventor or what can be said of him, the only and first inventor of this fast-growing trend, discipline, and study is that it accepts, rejects, and neglects its rights as a person that came into being not from a system, but from a human in the system that is unique by what his entire life reveals and conceals, and that he creates and destroys himself; first based on his reliance on tradition, and secondly, based on what he creates and destroys as light and in form of explanation. The technology understands the man more than he understands himself because it acknowledges that he is worth what he is willing to pay for and what his reality says is the reason for why he is in the state or condition he is. His expressive nature, that is man finds his belove when time is no longer considered to be valued or when it ends any attempt to define itself. This is the reason GeneWeb is an interactive web-server rather than a tool that exists for researchers and research in general. The problem seems to be, that my company sees a lack of influential identity and descriptive categories that are defined effectively.  It uses very efficient techniques of relationship and consanguinity computing, developed in collaboration with Didier R\u00e9my, research director at INRIA. GeneWeb is used as the engine for several public genealogy websites, including Geneanet, a collection of inter-searchable genealogical databases currently containing references to more than 225 million persons. This lack is contrary to the efficient network, that I must admit, exists for a purpose but only lives to mean diversity amongsts web-based tools and web-servers and web-based servers and services. GeneWeb, according to Google, means that specific evidence understands specific instructions, and this is the evidence of an atomic application that designs more missions than what any business owner or creator envisions: such formal expeditions of HTTML are methods that created programs, from nucleolar data are meant to retrieve. Management seems to be the only option. However, Web-servers being themselves produced by what Google has defined as Web Genealogical Technology is the compelling evidence of no creative activity, and therefore no collaboration amongst innovators. What the World Wide Web needs is quality inventors, such as myself, that provides a critical identity to web-servers versus web-tools, thus my business model uncovers a pre-existing debate within the web family and sees the future community changing society and culture by adopting an identifiable term of use for web-servers and web-tools and tools that use the cultural identity solution to marked databases that restore trust in leaders, that is reality as defined by the power in which it is termed, used, and applied as distinct and characteristically proportional to net addresses that has a reactive detail detachment from its media and image counter-relation experiential hypothesis.\n\nNotable features of GeneWeb include:\n\nHigh capacity:\n\nGeneWeb can allow multiple wizards to manage the genealogical database.\n\nGeneWeb can manage large databases: for example, the Roglo[4] database contains over 9 million entries, managed by more than 200 wizards.\n\nWeb Server: When GeneWeb runs on a computer connected to the internet, it can accept HTTP requests from web clients, generating and serving HTML web pages and linked objects (images, etc.).\n\nGEDCOM: GeneWeb supports import and export of GEDCOM files.\n\nUTF-8: GeneWeb supports UTF-8.\n\nReferences\n\nSoftware Review of: GeneWeb, A Web-Server, interactive approach to genealogy, by Larry Grosskopf, From the January, 2001 issue of PC Alamode Magazine\n\nThere are many genealogy tools available online that exist for the purpose of tracking your family\u2019s roots. Some of the best genealogy tools for 2023 according to TechRadar are Family Tree Maker, Ancestry.com, MyHeritage, Legacy Family Tree, and RootsMagic.\" Yet none of these genealogical tools are real; they are philosophies that imagine but never experience. I invented the term Web Genealogical Technology because in general, genealogical tools are contingent upon a temporary duty to fulfil an eternal serving role; this means that one cannot truly find their family by the order of technical, independent practice. The results would be the creation of a web-server that provides service in the form of notes, publicly shared and traded within critical variability that are systematic learners, and learning processes, which create norms and make change. The product does not exists in the world of management because the invisibility can not be measured and therefore can not be real. The web-tool is not based on relationship and interaction so Gene-Web in sum, is powerful but reasonably ineffective. Their mission is to create a world where everyone are stakeholders; meaning that to confess expertise is an experience, but to make specialists is a career and these two force fields are not equally compatible or practice to a successful web-based technological goal, or aim, and for that reason, even a rational system that consumes choice as being independently situated and financial beneficiary that rewards economic opportunity cost. Gene-Web is a bacteria that is back by Googles definition of Web-Based Servers, Services. and Tools employing the skills in sourcing talent about Web Genealogical Technology. it's becoming a virus. Since Google has a different definition than the one that I have, we may not as a people, be able or for that matter ready to realize the atomic problem. Google identifies Web Genealogical Technology and Mr. and Ms. Genet, (my business) identifies WebB Genealogical Technology. For the purposes of this Executive Summary, I define Web Genealogical Technology and (WebB) Genealogical Technology as \"the intellectual planning of an ingenuine and brilliant strategy that creates obstacles to the plan that makes ingenuity an effective role in the realization of the goal and also the delivery of the method, which creativity experiences itself by the intensity and model of the students inquisitiveness to technical lesson; that he learned, first by example, and second by imitating those who are forceful, choice-oriented, and discretionary without being aware: bound to themselves, it is those who have been most understood, and those who invented and then logically lead us to understand (Davis, 2023).\"\n\nLorenzo is the sole proprietor of this service based and product equipment venture. The strategic objective of this company is to eliminate the threat of the Corona/COVID 19 virus by getting pass the image. If society and ultimately culture do not act soon then we will be in an atomic war as a result of this terrible virus. God said in the Bible to not love the world or anything in it and yet we have witnessed the fruition of the New World Order and the creation of the World Wide Web. --(1 John 2:15-17)\n\nKing James Version\n\n15 \"Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.\n\n16 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.",

        "text": "Mr. and Ms. Genet essentially inspires people, that is genetically one human family to manage their life by managing money, building wealth, and building a wealth mentality that focuses on the dynamic history that has inspired us to be aware and traditionally enlightened by new information and ancestral vision. I build upon the current understanding of adaptable technology by articulating a unique story that justifies itself in genealogy and establishes the root for such conversation; thus my business methodology is scientific study that exists beyond the temporal world into the eternal dominion. What I do most is honor those who are lucky by seeing the means by which they can preserve legacy in how their heritage impressed future embracement with how they became to respect knowledge and a creative thought, prayer, and imagination that welcomes their condition, and drawls evidence from the probative elements, a true narrative that inspires, and affirms that they need a life-reflective experience, to be free while my business serves the desire to behave in ways that demonstrate my targeted customers wants. My business value proposition, therefore, is to inspire customers to have and reaffirm their convictions to have a greater and better relationship with life. This is the intangible goods that varies with intangible truths and reality and truths in reality. The historical significance of web genealogical technology is that it regresses the absence of an order in the system, which makes it consistent, and the system and order, which makes it relative, but persistent. We can even say, that this truth is universal in theory, and that it completes the evidence of design in creation rather than the arguments that give rise to its appearant presence.  _________________________________________________________________\n______________________________________________________",

Cardi B is underappreciated; she is more than just a hip hop artist, she is a model reality of exquisite ideas in which she offers fans like myself with gifts that they have not even begin to appreciate only because her music soothes the momentum and serves due justice to the user experience that is undoubtedly enabled to identify this award-winning celebrity and icon with the subject matter of interest, meaning the story behind her beautiful adoration and angelic perfections. In sum, Cardi B is an angel although some may view this personal description as too preliminary to see the future pattern not only in her music but in the evidence that justifies the story behind it.",

        "text": "CIA Recruitment\n\nThe CIA is, in my opinion, a new department of American government because it stands as a Republic Power. Plato\u2019s Republic is a Socratic dialogue concerning justice in the context of examining the character of the just man and the order of a just polity. Meaning that it exists for as long as it takes for Justice to rule the earth. (Psalm) 98:9 \"before the LORD, for he is coming to judge the earth. He will judge the world with justice, and the nations with fairness.\" New Living Translation. Thus, at this time the CIA will not need to inform the President of its sovereign intelligence power because everyone will already know that the agency is predominantly a recruiting agency that challenges the constitutional liberty within the nation; this makes the organization more prepared for business, offering freedom to many men and women internationally. Moral recruits lead kings and queens to the merciful throne of judgment, whereby they are crowned for having fulfilled their interdynamic mission and truth in a system that did not deny them the right to that order. The CIA, I believe, rejects the very covert process that their role as a security and  intelligence force accepts. That is, the recruitment of the CIA Beloved Atomic Reality and the subsequent recognition of me, Lorenzo Maurice Davis as the belove king of the CIA, a title that was given to me from an inspired message, that I believe till this day, was none other than Yahshua.",

        "text": "Shifting Ideas To The Social Elements of Truth\n\nCreation is born by the psychological imagination and truth has remained ignorant of its social counter-parts but not its philosophical partners. With that said, psychology as a discipline is in trouble with the methodology of how it reveals itself to the world, and this visible ethic is linked to its scientific perspective. Changing the method is but one way in a long process to change the thought and subsequently the behavioral study. I propose that integrity leads us to a wisdom of no return whereby our view and meaning of life changes and then we are influenced by financial education and principles to produce the dramatic mental images in media. Finally, we are given an incentive to accumulate wealth by understanding the reason for our contributions; in a variety of forms, we offer private definitions of a human and animal identity with what we are most interested in being and what we are compassionate about the most. \n\nThere is no other time that is more sensitive than now; with the recent death of Stanton E. Samenow, an American psychologist and writer, we have witnessed a criminal event that is not derived from a comparable set of situations. What Samuel Yochelson and Samenow knew was that the criminal personality, existing for recognition was not a far away idea from reality, but the criminal thinking error manifest an interdependent reality in patterns as well as in replicated evidence. The personality therefore becomes in a sense, distinct from the criminal, and the environment in which a person is born is not observable due to an individuals unwillingness to change, yet society and culture change at two equal rhythms and this activity warrants a rational basis for the criminal being capable of permanent change so long as he doesn't fall within the trap of his own environment; however, Yochelson and Samenow should have expressed the importance of thinking so we can understand how to make right decisions and how to avoid the errors in thinking, to such an extent that we as a society can no longer identify the criminal as criminal and to such an extent that the belief in a productive citizen will become a reality, and the government will be the forerunner of awareness that respects an evolving world and purposeful existence.\n\n I believe that destiny has called me to be the author of this blog in that it will improve my writing skills as an author and might even help me sale some of my own self-published books. I wrote two books about intimacy and one of them says that the book contributes to the development of psychology.

        "text": "2. Fear \u2013 Fears in the criminal are widespread, persistent, and intense; especially fears of \nbeing caught for something, fear of injury or death, and fear of a putdown.\nMy Response\u2014Fear is what inmates will seek when their enviornments provide no other \nalternatives. It is a way for criminals to feel comfortable with their own perceptions, leaving \ndestiny entirely out of their control. In some way, criminals have acknowledge that their actions \nbrought them to their current understanding, but that understanding, it must appear to the \ncriminal is \u201cnot where the criminal wants to be\u201d It is because their surroundings have presented a \nsociety that is too immature to meet their needs and wants and a culure that reinforces the \nconsistent message of failure by forcing the belief on the criminal that their is only one way out \nof their situation. This leaves no room to embrace, so the criminal becomes sort of a philosopher \nwhereby he begins to ponder on the reality of fear. Again he finds a contradiction, but this \ncontradiction is unknown to what he perceives. He decides to embark upon other activities in \norder to occupy his time. He must not know that courage only gets him so far in the absence of \nfear, and that hope is meaningless to what he thinks as a person, and that a contract with society \nbeyond the reality of a choice is courage that\u2019s invisible in the way he thinks because it has \nprovided value to what he doesn\u2019t think he knows. Knowledge as the criminal understands it is \nelusive but a must to value the comfort of value; it is an enemy, the criminal will think to fear, \nand fear, I argue, is an enemy to society and to culture. Yet researchers need to know it in order \nto understand why fear is so widespread, persistent, and intense in the criminal. Is it because fear \nis trying to tell the criminal something. Is what the criminal fears being caught for likely the \nunknown contradiction that he has arrived at a new truth; such as the fear of injury or death \nwhich runs rampant and is a common belief in prison. Is the criminal more credible than the \nresearcher who doesn\u2019t see the criminal for who he or she is. This could be I assert because of a \nlack of compassion, hope has evolved the discipline without the elements of encourgagement. \nThis suggests that their is a lack of understanding fear. The criminal may fear a putdown, for \nexample, but this fear and this evident putdown, may be presently justified. This book takes the \nreader past the social contract to fear: the picture of justice without law.\n3. Zero State \u2013 This is the periodic experience of oneself as being nothing, \u201ca zero\u201d; a \nfeeling of absolute worthlessness, hopelessness, and futility.\nMy Response\u2014This definition of Zero State may only apply to a criminal who is serving time in \nprison and time, which is value, is what a criminal finds comfort in. So when we are in a state of \nZero State, this yet again submits to him a contraction of the order, which an inmate can see is in \nthe system. This evidence is holistic, and therefore contrary to the contradiction that I have argued a criminal finds himself in. Yochelson and Samenow have defined the criminal above but \nhave not described him. This book argues that one must first describe the criminal and then \ndefine him in order to solve the problem of mistaken identity when it comes to people attempting \nto identify the criminal, which can quite possibly be an inmate. \n4. Anger \u2013 Anger is a basic part of the criminal\u2019s way of life. He or she responds angrily to \nanything interpreted as opposing what he or she wants. Anger is, for the criminal, a major \nway of controlling people and situations. \nMy Response\u2014Criminals desire to know and not to know thier enviornment; this causes the \ncriminal to imagine things other than himself that can control the enviornment. But this in a \nsense, creates anger and this anger doesn\u2019t provide the criminal anything new as an incentive for \ndesiring to directly control people or situations. What the criminal wants is clarity not in his life, \nbut in his vision. Anger is, for the criminal, a minor truth of control\u2014that what one comprehends \nin some ways determines how successful a person is. This is incomplete evidence however, and \ndoesn\u2019t have a relationship to anything. It does mean, moreover, that truth was arrived at without \nmeaning.\n5. Pride \u2013 Criminal pride is an extreme high evaluation of oneself. It is the idea that one is \nbetter than others, even when this is clearly not the case. Criminal pride preserves his or \nher rigid self-image as a powerful, totally self-determining person.\nMy Response\u2014Criminals are prideful because they lack a vision\u2014the same with all of us, we \nmust never sin just for the sake of sinning. Instead, theirs a purpose for the reason criminals \nexists and that is why we have taken an interests in the way that they think. But to suggest that \npride is justified by only who the criminal is, as Yochelson and Samenow does, is to say that \npride is not a sin but is power, in the sense that it is criminal. Reality may confirm to the criminal \nthat he is not better than others, but this won\u2019t change the criminal. Pride may change the \ncriminal thinking error, when we discover the hope that a criminals personality can change. So \nwhat we have in criminology is a temporary description of the criminal by employing the \ndiscipline of psychology in order to understand the personality of the ideal criminal and not the \ncriminal reality. What I have just done is introduce you to the criminal reality in response to the \nterm criminal pride.\n6. The Power Thrust \u2013 Criminals need control and power over others. The greatest power \nexcitement is doing the forbidden and getting away with it. The need for power, control, \nand dominance shows in all areas of their lives. The occasions when criminals appear to \nshow an interest in a responsible activity are generally opportunities for criminals to \nexercise power and control. \nMy Response\u2014In one way Yochelson and Samenow are correct, criminals need power over \nothers but why do they need? Criminals in some way, already have control and Yochelson and \nSamenow have not explained why they need it over others. Does social control oppose the \ncriminal? The need for control only partially shows in criminals and Yochelson and Samenow \nhave not convincingly demonstrated the criminal. 7. Sentimentality \u2013 Criminals are often excessively sentimental about their mothers, old \npeople, invalids, animals, babies, their love attachments, and plans for the future\nMy Response\u2014Criminals live in a isolated world, and they learn habits that will be considered \nabnormal to society and to their culture\u2014that is the culture that welcomed them in.\n8. Religion \u2013 Criminals use religion to support their way of thinking and their criminality. \nTheir religious ideas are usually very literal and concrete. Religion (like sentimentality) \ndoes not consistently deter criminal thinking or actions, but does support the criminal\u2019s \nself-image as a good and decent person. \nMy Response\u2014This is the best description that Yochelson and Samenow have given regarding \nthe criminal. However, the criminal knows that he is not liked by society.\n9. Concrete Thinking \u2013 Criminals tend to think in terms of particular objects and events, \nrather than general and abstract concepts. \nMy Response\u2014Criminals view education as a game. Information is obtained by the games that \nthey play.\nCriminal thinking is the only remedy that our customs view as indicative of the vision that we \nattire and aspire to. We see to many opinions when we are engaging with individual truth, that \nwe can never eliminate our need for a more robust type of system. This means that we are \npatterned and viewed in the light that is favorable to the many rather than the few. We know that \nour concious minds is where we direct our uncouncious mind to act and enact the directions that \nwe deem is important. :When thinking about wheter to engage with an unfamiliar stimuli, we \nusually tend to prejudge the individual rather than getting to know the person.",

        "text": "This understanding is the \nholistic theme of my book, and this is the real reason that justifies wisdom, because destiny is the \nchild of wisdom only because wisdom, the bible tells us is justified by her children. This proves \nthat destiny exists whereas my previous book proved why reason exists because it pointed to \nYahshua. This is the real reason why I have titled this book, destiny not mercy because as stated \nabove, I have proved that destiny exists, not mercy. I argue an inmate seeks this understanding \nand finds it when he finds the reflection of the wisdom and the wisdom of reflection. That is \nwhen he discovers the true value. He nolonger believes that he is highly energitic when he finds \nhis or her destiny, that is when I argue he seeks mercy. Mercy confirms his intent, and then he \ndesires to change his thinking only to find again a sense of newness in an ideal value, one that is \nnot described or defined. This book is relevant for social scientists who have discovered a \nhypothesis that creates a question\u2014since money anwers everything this book presents the \npotential measurements that a scientists can measure in order to investigate their or someone \nelses question or come up with new ones on their own. We must in all peer-reviewed writing \npresent something that provides value to the audience; thus, to understand to prove or disprove \nthe criminal being highly energitic one must first discover the criminals value; this I still assert \ndemands compassion and not what some may view suscipicion as or what they think it should \nbe. We know that perceptions are important, but this fact still presents the evident truth of what \nwe know, which means that truth is discovered before meaning, if not at all distinct, because the inmate only becomes the criminal we can agree, after his enviornment confirms that he is \nnothing and one with loneliness\u2014in a way. And in not any way, thus it is not a paradox the \ncriminal faces but a reality that is to difficult to tell if it is equal with an ideal or meets [the ideal] \nthis being the conservative understanding of an ideal that offers convincing understanding into \nnot only how, why, and what a criminal thinking error is but also the grounding evidence a \ncriminal becomes less energized by the reason for his or her surrounding circumstances and for \nhis or her identity. This reason is what psychology should study because it is the legal engine by \nitself that reveals the truth of my contribution to psychology. It may be that my thesis is \nadmittedly inherently critical and this could be a limitation. I am not a scholarly researcher; I am \na student of education. I seek only in this book to provide an extended and alternative \nexplanation to traditional research. This approach adds value to any interests that psychology \nmight have or will have in my work as it contributes compassion to its development, first by \nsticking to the equality of the description and the definition. Thus, in order to understand the \nreason for this book, the researcher or reader must start with the description of the criminal and \nthen extend themselves to the criminals definition. This is what this book will call \u201cinvisible \ncompassion\u201d and might validate the above research of the definition of the criminal\u2014that he is \nhighly energitic. Nevertheless, if my work doesn\u2019t, then it still provides sufficient information for \nsocial scientists and other researchers to arrive at logical conclusions based on the value that they \nshould discover from this book as well as the compassion that they will most definitely feel when \napplying the principles invented solely by my experiences as a criminal. Thus my work should \ntake the researcher unto interesting landscape by unquestionably remaining silent about the \njourney. It is morevoer, the upcoming destination that this book focuses on and meaning without \ntruth will never get us there. We need meaning, and then we need to forget it, so as to make a \nreality the only thing we ever had was truth. This truth is in part, the reason why I have titled my \nbook destiny not mercy. Being aware that a destination exists soley depends on the value, and \nundoubtely doubts the destiny. This is why my compassionate critics will say that we need \nmercy, and therefore my book itself is futile. But they are missing the point. The reason love \nexists is to overcome, and we know that love can not exists by only remembering itself. But the \nreason love exist is to conquer in how we become\u2014this means in a reality of truth, mercy exists \nto free the thought, prayer, and imagination of destiny from destroying itself with contrary \nevidence of its impact with meaning. In short, my critics misses the point, we have destiny \nbecause it exists, we don\u2019t have mercy because meaning does not exists in understanding of the \ndestination. \nA psycologist in prison once told me that I am most likely to committ another crime when I get \nreleased from prison because I am excited and based on the statistical information, that I am \nprojected to have a desire to relive my youth, such desire being important because I spent my \nformibble youthful years in prison and therefore my growth was most likely stunted, and this is \nwhy, the psychologist suggested, I have a propensity to commit crime because I have a rational \nexplanation to get excited. But this, I argued is not ethical in research because it limits choice to \nthat of the desire, ultimately implying that in psycology the human is not that as important as that \nof the animal or not important at all compared to an animal. The choice is irrelevant when we \nconsider the birth of the attitude, undoubtely I committed more crimes when I got released from \nprison, but time is value and being free from prison is an exciting thing that people in general should value. Finally, criminal thinking errors is normative potential; this provides hope for the \nfuture. The assumption is that this is a criminal personality; however, the reason is the same and \nunique in that the criminal identity definition alone doesn\u2019t lead to an outcome whereas the \ndescription and then definition that I have attempted to provide in my response, leads to a \njustifiable one, and this is all the more clear why we should focus on the understanding of the \nfuture.",

        "text": "suggesting the conclusion that a criminal feels, \nthinks, and acts in a way less than him or herself when the enviornment itself confirms that truth \nof reality\u2014I say truth because its important for psychologists to understand thier own limitations \nwhen identifying the personality of another, it may be that the discipline itself, apart from the \npsychologist lacks wisdom to effectively influence the criminal in such a way that he or she will \ncease altogether from committing crime only because unlike his enviornment which is \nmysterious in some way or another, he feels like he is understood by the psychologists, thus a \npsychologist, I assert in my previous book, must relate himself to the energy that attracts \ncuriosity, not only in the moral reality, but also in the journey, which I now contend inevitably \ndemands itself to be compassionate and adds quality to the tasks by contributing compassion \nobjectively to the order. This suggest that destiny is real and therefore that much more important \nif psychology is going to advance itself as a discipline. The hypothesis would be to test the \nsystem, which is invisible but appearant to the order. We know this by what reality the criminal \nconfirms for his or herself. However, we can see where science is useful in expanding the \nparticular value that we only get from research; this book is the foundation of knowledge\u2014that \nis critical in nature about how we distinguish the subjective and objective effects of measuring a \npersuavive hypothesis. The criminal may be highly energitic, but we need to first question where \nsuch descriptions obtain an identity; then with this information, we can research the value that a criminal without question gains by looking at his individual stories in relationship to our own. \nMy critics might argue that my theme is in someway incomplete because aside from the \ninaccurrate information that one will obtain by looking at how my thinking added value to my \nlife, we can see that I was an inmate itself and more likely to be what could be identified as a \ncriminal itself. Such errors my critics will argue does not strengthen current understandings of \nsocial science research much less contribute to a psychologists belief about criminal thinking \nerrors; it is hyperbole and even outlandish to assume that the criminal such as (myself) will have \na credible solution to the problem of crime, criminal behavior, and arguably criminal thinking \nsince law as argued in my last book takes intent highly and very seriously into account. It may be \nbetter, afterall, for people to be suspicious and stick to the conservative republican tradition of \npunishment in our country rather than the liberal ideal of rehabilitation for the inmate, which the \nliberal will contend is also for societal as a whole. I believe that conservative understanding is \nthe solution to the procrastanation that we have required by our inexperience of relating to \nablility as a value in itself coupled with the reflection of good that we all strive for privately. We \nhave socially contracted to reality more than we have consented to the ideal, and while \nconservative dialouge admittedly doesn\u2019t seem plausible in a progressive system, freeing \nourselves from that system requires us to balance the order itself with our conservative \ntraditional idealogy. Achieving such a balance, mostly requires us to be logical, but there are \ntimes when we must see the abnormal behave just for the belief itself to bear fruit in our society \nand ultimately in our culture. This is a system without mercy but an order that starts with destiny. \nThis is what I define as the difference between a conservative and a liberal and effectively \nlooking into the identity of a person temporarily offers us a battle whereas the war that ends with \nlove and laughter is the value. Arriving at that value I assert is a universal endeavor, because it \nhelps everyone who conquers understand the bright and morning star truth of reality for the sake \nof understanding why it is the only thing that is not judged itself.",

        "text": "Lorenzo Maurice Davis, Author\n\n\"Destiny Not Mercy: Researching Meaning\"\n\nThus I conclude below first with my description and then with my definition of the criminal \nbased on my own thinking errors and in my response to criminologists and psychologists \nYochelson and Samenow.\nTHINKING ERRORS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE CRIMINAL (Yochelson and Samenow\u2019s \n\u201cThe Criminal Personality\u201d) \n1. Energy \u2013 The criminal is extremely energetic. His or her high level of mental activity is \ndirected to a flow of ideas as to what would make life more interesting and exciting.\nMy Response\u2014The criminal is mysteriously indulged in his own world, he views himself as a \nlonely being that doesn\u2019t deserve attention\u2014the healthy behavior that is incumbent upon us all. Iam a former inmate, and I have experienced loneliness when I least expected such a condition to \noccur, I blamed my circumstance on the need to do better but did not have a plan on how I was \ngoing to free myself from my imprisonment. All I knew was that my choices and in some way \nmy actions have brought me to the place I was then at, and that I needed to learn something in \norder to do better. This belief, which I do not know if I inherited it from my family or even \nsociety was ingrained in me and arguably in my type of thinking. It give me a false sense of \npurpose that I am already doing better and therefore I got excited by the promise. Yet I was still \nincarcerated. Facing the reality, I couldn\u2019t in reality make sense of my situation so I sought to \nlearn but this new endeavor brought with it grief, and I felt as if I was violated similar to the pain \nand harm that I caused others outside of prison. This awareness was unknown to me at the time, \nso all I had to rely on was the information that I received from my enviornment and most of the \nstories that were being told from an inmate perspective sounded all the same. This kind of \nbehavior I contend is important for psychologists to study because I was unlike the energetic \nideal criminal highly overwhelmed by the consistency of information. I undoubtely yearned to \nexperience something new, but did not receive effective feedback from my enviornment. I found \nmyself isolated and therefore more likely to argue with my circumstances rather than attempt to \nfind a solution to my current problem. What I needed was energy. The value that could be \nmeasured by researchers is that I was too excited as an inmate and the data that is relevant would \nbe reasearchers looking into the events that were frequent and confirmed by my experience with \ndealing with them and one can even conclude that such experience creates a story that is equal to \nmy personal value, that being objective\u2014we can gather evidence by our measurements in order \nto arrive at logical conclusions about criminal thinking errors and the criminal more specifically. \nThis will require that we add value to existing research or that we contribute in some meaningful \nway to the developement of it. What I have provided in this book is an alternative explanation to \nthe criminal itself being defined as energitic by looking at the circumstances surrounding the \ncriminal and by looking at the criminal itself by",

        "text": "Yet none of these genealogical tools are real; they are philosophies that imagine but never experience. I invented the term Web Genealogical Technology because in general, genealogical tools are contingent upon a temporary duty to fulfil an eternal serving role; this means that one cannot truly find their family by the order of technical, independent practice. The results would be the creation of a web-server that provides service in the form of notes, publicly shared and traded within critical variability that are systematic learners, and learning processes, which create norms and make change. The product does not exists in the world of management because the invisibility can not be measured and therefore can not be real. The web-tool is not based on relationship and interaction so Gene-Web in sum, is powerful but reasonably ineffective. Their mission is to create a world where everyone are stakeholders; meaning that to confess expertise is an experience, but to make specialists is a career and these two force fields are not equally compatible or practice to a successful web-based technological goal, or aim, and for that reason, even a rational system that consumes choice as being independently situated and financial beneficiary that rewards economic opportunity cost. Gene-Web is a bacteria that is back by Googles definition of Web-Based Servers, Services. and Tools employing the skills in sourcing talent about Web Genealogical Technology. it's becoming a virus. Since Google has a different definition than the one that I have, we may not as a people, be able or for that matter ready to realize the atomic problem. Google identifies Web Genealogical Technology and Mr. and Ms. Genet, (my business) identifies WebB Genealogical Technology. For the purposes of this Executive Summary, I define Web Genealogical Technology and (WebB) Genealogical Technology as \"the intellectual planning of an ingenuine and brilliant strategy that creates obstacles to the plan that makes ingenuity an effective role in the realization of the goal and also the delivery of the method, which creativity experiences itself by the intensity and model of the students inquisitiveness to technical lesson; that he learned, first by example, and second by imitating those who are forceful, choice-oriented, and discretionary without being aware: bound to themselves, it is those who have been most understood, and those who invented and then logically lead us to understand (Davis, 2023).\"\n\nLorenzo is the sole proprietor of this service based and product equipment venture. The strategic objective of this company is to eliminate the threat of the Corona/COVID 19 virus by getting pass the image. If society and ultimately culture do not act soon then we will be in an atomic war as a result of this terrible virus. God said in the Bible to not love the world or anything in it and yet we have witnessed the fruition of the New World Order and the creation of the World Wide Web. --(1 John 2:15-17)\n\nKing James Version\n\n15 \"Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.\n\n16 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.\n\n17 And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.\" Corona threatens the destiny of social media in the sense that COVID 19 disconnects the traditional relationship between social media and social media networking existence. This is because the virus is ahead of it's time but there's a time for coronavirus to end the numerology of the number 19. I created an atomic number that solves this problem after I prayed in March of 2018 for God, the Maker of Heaven to give me the skills needed to help solve the problem of the coronavirus and I received wisdom, (at least enough of it) to create my own atomic reality which ultimately resulted an a solution to the problem of COVID 19-- thus my atomic formula substracts the COVID number identity by -1 this also gets my universe past the viruses image by adding 3 to the 2nd power + and reality then submits to truth-- this corona problem is consequently solved by -1 the atomic vision of love. Love conquers all, it conquers knowledge so that the lust will not be realized, it conquers the eyes so that it will not see, it conquers pride that will see humility, and this means that love conquers us. Time has an end. And we are seen by faith, the restorative moment in which social media trends are growing.  shortly before the Washington State earthquake. I received an idea in August, the same month that I got locked up in King County Jail when I was 18 years old and a earthquake occurred in the jail when I was 18. I won a prize at the Orion Center in Seattle Washington but was absent and did not receive it. At the group home where I currently live at, we are on administrative lock down due to the prevalence of COVID 19 incidences. I filed a complaint in which I published and posted on YouTube outlining the misconduct by my case manager regarding a previous coronavirus outbreak; however I stated in the complaint that this case worker has an imagination. Mr. and Ms. Genet is a business of imagination -- not only do we outline a demonstrated plan to produce wealth we share our invention on how search engine optimization records the informative data about the connected independence and disconnected relationship which is a paradox in existence and the independent existing transit security, systematic code from social media and that of social media organizing social networking order and value. Thus corona threatens the image by rationalize logic and essentially in bombs social media and effects the concept of marketing science. I argued in my book, \"The Reason Love Exist: Laughter Is Living\" that corona/ COVID exists and there are 19 non-existent problems, which means that it loves to some extent but it desictimizes itself and lives actually, which is a contradiction to order-- corona kills COVID basically by what it dreams and how it answers questions that are loving experiences within themselves, thus the virus is a mystery in that it dreams of a reality that confronts reality to itself, but this mystery is solved by receiving the blessing from the creator who is different then the Maker that tells you the wisdom of reflection and the reflection of the wisdom, the sound voice that commanded your understanding of judging the value within value and value itself valued values the two sides of wisdom. My business argues that corona COVID 19 epidemic issue and virus problem itself can be solved by the disposition of intimacy and by the wisdom of no return. This means that we must have a new kind of WEB ( WEbB) and we can do this. We are already on the journey to progress--- because the (SEO) Search Engine Optimization will discover a choice but exists based on a decision to have a private security, that ultimately identifies value, creates a new type of WEB, --- and produces the invention of wealth that appreciates the technology authorization that honors the legacy of change in power from the noble birth of genealogy.",

        "text": "Mr. and Ms. Genet is owned and operated by Lorenzo Maurice Davis, an inventor of webB genealogical technology. According to Google, \"Web genealogical technology refers to the use of technology to research and trace family history'. This definition is misleading because technology and genealogy together make up the study of historical order, and there is no discipline yet to be created that archaeology and anthropology described in their paradoxical mission. This means that Web-Based tools are created to be witnesses about the future design of a genealogical finding that is economically unique with respect to the creativity of the personal and social narrative, meaning that all research into the promising service is dependent upon the independent integrity of the account. I say this because our current understanding of our ancestral link is a historical one, but we are not aware of the relevant facts that shape our society and our culture. Scientists tend to look at the relative sources of remnant discoveries and digital antiquity--thus, they use deductive reason as a method to enable an atmospheric mark on searches and significant impact to dynamic causes. This approach promotes the interests of scientific research and education while being conservative about one's individual duty to present thorough information to one's social circle and contribute to a community of ethical identity; all the more liberal in nature to never account for bias as a fact in personality; to generate wealth means that doubt, (even if it is created, and social scientists are considered to be liars), must be criticized and if an unidentified order exists, then such order must eliminate any element of prediction or conditional consequences, by repeating behavior, archeology and anthropology believe, we can assist the brain with how it adapts to pressure, interacts with sensate reality and view all perceptions as utilitarian in element, which creates destruction in whoever created and made life, but it leaves research as a science, autonomous because we experience more than hope--making relevant use of the remnant of information that we know, inspires learning and doesn't fail to acknowledge the inspiration, which could be a new invention; however, we believe that truth is known by the knowledge that is accurately represented and is a Web-server ruler that the future will one day be forced to see. The only problem is that reality submits to truth not in what it will see, like the discipline of archaeology and anthropology contest, but in what it has already seen and saw, absent of external influence. With that said, everything that I have said up to this point is meaningless. Logic is not logic is the higher truth of my company's higher investigation. Genealogy software lets you build your family tree and record relevant information about your ancestors. We need a new architect that exists in an environment of success and finds his own challenge warranted by a new kind of software application--that tools will only be required when one is able and capable of matching what he experiences with, and this is limited, but a responsibility because it is based on economic choice and financial literacy, to produce the equivalent existent opportunity that unifies a preferred network while making use of the unique identifying web-server.  This includes dates, locations, relationships, and others. You can also take note of your research sources and even link them to the family tree that you have created. You can keep multiple databases for numerous family trees. You may also print out your ancestral charts and family tree or share them with other people electronically. Additionally, you can store your photos as well as audio and video records along with scanned documents related to your ancestors. The dillemma is only real in appearance and the web does not have the same inalienable source as a computer without the Internet. The software also has a backup feature, so you can keep your information protected as it assists you by providing tips on how and where to search. Searching ancestral data is the by-product of a mini-invention within GeneWeb, a landmark visitor-based relationship that is based primarily on magic, which sets the standard science for data-based communication restructuring artificial intelligence, leviathan perceptions that are restored in memory, both real and imagined, which results in a new web or a new web technology which grounds existing fictious creations with hard facts that can be tangible in nature, but as of yet, GeneWeb has not produced a new type of tool that justifies equality as it is perhaps evolvingly thought or perceived. GeneWeb is a free multi-platform genealogy software tool created and owned by Daniel de Rauglaudre of INRIA. GeneWeb is accessed by a Web browser, either off-line or as a server in a Web environment. The problem with GeneWeb is that it is an ideological concept, not a theory and it is not creative in the sense that it is in itself not a reliable or credible development because it is not an invention. Lorenzo Maurice Davis invented a new channel. This truth is not contingent or adequately representative of a definition in or about anything in or around existence. What we know now is that love exists. How we become owners of realestate into this highly complex area is that we don't see the field as a force, but rather an influence in the world of decisions; thus, this system is not defined, but it in itself, is special because it assumes that it is the only person qualified to identify. WebB Genealogical Technology as Lorenzo, the inventor or what can be said of him, the only and first inventor of this fast-growing trend, discipline, and study is that it accepts, rejects, and neglects its rights as a person that came into being not from a system, but from a human in the system that is unique by what his entire life reveals and conceals, and that he creates and destroys himself; first based on his reliance on tradition, and secondly, based on what he creates and destroys as light and in form of explanation. The technology understands the man more than he understands himself because it acknowledges that he is worth what he is willing to pay for and what his reality says is the reason for why he is in the state or condition he is. His expressive nature, that is man finds his belove when time is no longer considered to be valued or when it ends any attempt to define itself. This is the reason GeneWeb is an interactive web-server rather than a tool that exists for researchers and research in general. The problem seems to be, that my company sees a lack of influential identity and descriptive categories that are defined effectively.  It uses very efficient techniques of relationship and consanguinity computing, developed in collaboration with Didier R\u00e9my, research director at INRIA. GeneWeb is used as the engine for several public genealogy websites, including Geneanet, a collection of inter-searchable genealogical databases currently containing references to more than 225 million persons. This lack is contrary to the efficient network, that I must admit, exists for a purpose but only lives to mean diversity amongsts web-based tools and web-servers and web-based servers and services.  Management seems to be the only option. However, Web-servers being themselves produced by what Google has defined as Web Genealogical Technology is the compelling evidence of no creative activity, and therefore no collaboration amongst innovators. What the World Wide Web needs is quality inventors, such as myself, that provides a critical identity to web-servers versus web-tools, thus my business model uncovers a pre-existing debate within the web family and sees the future community changing society and culture by adopting an identifiable term of use for web-servers and web-tools and tools that use the cultural identity solution to marked databases that restore trust in leaders, that is reality as defined by the power in which it is termed, used, and applied as distinct and characteristically proportional to net addresses that has a reactive detail detachment from its media and image counter-relation experiential hypothesis.\n\nNotable features of GeneWeb include:\n\nHigh capacity:\n\nGeneWeb can allow multiple wizards to manage the genealogical database.\n\nGeneWeb can manage large databases: for example, the Roglo[4] database contains over 9 million entries, managed by more than 200 wizards.\n\nWeb Server: When GeneWeb runs on a computer connected to the internet, it can accept HTTP requests from web clients, generating and serving HTML web pages and linked objects (images, etc.).\n\nGEDCOM: GeneWeb supports import and export of GEDCOM files.\n\nUTF-8: GeneWeb supports UTF-8.\n\nReferences\n\nSoftware Review of: GeneWeb, A Web-Server, interactive approach to genealogy, by Larry Grosskopf, From the January, 2001 issue of PC Alamode Magazine\n\nThere are many genealogy tools available online that exist for the purpose of tracking your family\u2019s roots. Some of the best genealogy tools for 2023 according to TechRadar are Family Tree Maker, Ancestry.com, MyHeritage, Legacy Family Tree, and RootsMagic.\" Yet none of these genealogical tools are real; they are philosophies that imagine but never experience. I invented the term Web Genealogical Technology because in general, genealogical tools are contingent upon a temporary duty to fulfil an eternal serving role; this means that one cannot truly find their family by the order of technical, independent practice. \nLorenzo is the sole proprietor of this service based and product equipment venture.
