This is what the Bible says about it.. \r\n\"The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil. They will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\" Matthew 13: 41-42\r\nJesus Christ is the only way to heaven \"I am the way, the truth, and the life no one comes to the father but by me.\"  John 14:6   Ask God to reveal this to you- He will! \r\n\"For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.\" Romans 3:23 ADMIT THAT YOU'RE A SINNER. We've all broken God's laws and ten commandments.. \"Thou shalt not lie, steal, covet, dishonor parents, take God's name in vain..\"(Exodus 20) We do not have righteousness on our own to get to heaven, \"God made him (Jesus) who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.\" 2 Cor. 5:21 Godly sorrow leads to genuine repentance for sinning against the righteous God and there is a change of heart, we change our mind and God changes our hearts and regenerates us from the inside out. God is deadly serious about sin, when we genuinely repent we hate sin just as God hates it, and we turn away from it.\r\n\"But God commended His love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us.\" Romans 5:8 BELIEVE IN YOUR HEART THAT JESUS CHRIST DIED FOR YOUR SINS, WAS BURIED, AND THAT GOD RAISED JESUS FROM THE DEAD. This is trusting with all of your heart that Jesus Christ is who he said he was. He saves us from sin and hell and brings us into a relationship with him. We become God's children. We are saved from hell, eternal death.\r\n\"For whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.\" Romans 10:13 CALL UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD. Every single person who ever lived since Adam will bend their knee and confess with their mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, the Lord of Lords and the King of Kings.\r\nRead the Bible, Walk with the Lord and give your life to Him!",

He just felt over\u2026 and was gone\u2026 totally out of the blue\u2026 and seriously,   It doesn't hurt less after some years.  Just,  life is more around me, surrounding me.

This song feels like I wrote it, every single word is what I feel. Even down to the words \"I pictured this year a little bit different when it hit February\". February was when he got transferred to a neuro rehabilitation centre, and we thought this was the break he needed. But the hospital had let him down so badly over the 3 months he was there that his body was near unfixable by the time he arrived.",

What makes it even harder is that a week and a half ago my family lost our family dog who was just as close to him as the actual family was.  We all felt like that little guy Trigger carried a piece of dad\u2019s soul all these years later, so it feels like that wound just got ripped right back open.  Nevertheless you have to find a way to keep going and songs like this really help remind me of that.  I\u2019ve always appreciated your music Ed but this song I would have to say is my favorite, other than shivers and bad habits.  Thank you for always putting out amazing content we as your audience love.",

Hitting rock bottom and trying to be with her again. Having so many memories with her in the town i grew up in, that i eventually had to move to save myself. \nIt's been 14 years and i'm doing good now, but it was a very hard time. \nNever give up\ud83c\udf40",

Everytime I listen to this makes the pain worse, but it's such a beautiful song .This is my story : I lost my beautiful Husband Troy in February 2023... I don't know how I could ever feel any happiness again. We were married 20 years in December 2022. Luckily we made It to our 20th Wedding Anniversary. My darling was only 53 years old... He was so very sick with lung cancer but we were under the belief that he had more time. He died a horrific painful death very suddenly and cruely.. Some days I can smile and live but most of the time I'm just existing.. I don't want to be here anymore... All I have left is my Dad who is 80 years old and sick... As soon as he is gone I pray to the Lord to take me to my baby.. Please, Lord..",

Sometimes in life we just had to be on our own remembering the person who were important to us, and pay our salute and respects. We wish them well even though that person are not with us anymore (whether they have passed away or already left you).",

He passed away two days shy of what would have been our 30th wedding anniversary and some days I feel like I am doing exactly what you sing about. I still see him, feel him, everywhere. Our daughter has always been a big fan of yours, and she introduced me to your music. What you write and sing about touches people deeply. You are such an intuitive singer/songwriter and your songs are full of raw emotion, and evoke the same. My daughter and son-in-law even used your song Perfect for their wedding song, as it really does describe the love they have together (they have been a couple since they were 15, married 5 years yesterday, and now have a beautiful little girl, 2 years old). As much as this song made me cry, I know I need to let it out, and it's so beautiful, even as it is heartwrenching. It is the mark of true talent to be able to evoke so many different emotions in your fans. Thank you for sharing your gift with us all.\u2764",

YOU are a spiritual giant to help us heal as many of us grieve!  This song.... and your \"Sum\" of All Things\" is SO VERY cathartic and healing for me... For my family!  We lost our 24 y.o. son/nephew, Bridger, 8 mos. ago!  He took his own life!  My other son was the last to be with him....     THIS soulful, deep heartfelt, raw, kind, wise, generous, vulnerable, honest music from your heart 'in' your own grieving has given me... And our family, a strength, even a unity with another precious soul,  YOU!   You have expressed with your body and music the pains we are feeling!  I feel  hope BECAUSE you let us know and experience that we are not alone in these feelings... in this grief... in the tears!!                                          Thanks for being true to the divine gifts that are yours as you lift this grieving world to a higher hope!  AND.... now,  take care of yourself and your family as you continue the important path you are on!       I pray perfect fitting blessings for you and your family in this year of 'firsts' without your brother J. E.       I wish we were neighbors... my gr gr gr grandparents and family lived in Hastings and other parts of Essex!   I wish we could have a joined family woodland or mountain picnic with you and yours to share in this journey together!     Bridger's sister and her husband were at your cowboy stadium American tour opening concert!   They LOVED YOU AND YOUR MUSIC SO VERY MUCH!!  And they cried with you.    THANKS for being on earth at this time...    WE ALL  need you!     LT",

You are human and the performance was even better showing your emotions.  I lost both my parents (who were also my best friends) within the last 2 years.  UGH  Between last month and this month, I experienced Mother's Day, my Mom's 2 year death anniversary, my Mom's birthday, Father's Day, and my Dad's 1 year death anniversary without them.  I heard this song on the radio today and found myself dancing with my eyes closed while crying.  At the same time, I felt my Mom's strong presence and knew she was dancing right along beside me (as she often did while she was living).  Loved it and love your music!!!  Thank you",
