We went into an underpass though a mountain and it was super dark. The lights in the underpass quickly went by in my peripheral vision and it was dark otherwise. As soon as we left the underpass the song hit 2:07 it was no longer raining. The air smelled so good and the sun shined into our car.It was so sunny that it was like a flash of light leaving the underpass. The ocean waves were hitting the shore so hard and the there were not other cars but us. It's hard to describe how heavenly it was. I don't think I'll ever feel that close to peace on earth again,but that was a wonderful memory.",

        "text": "This song, every time I listen to it is a breath of fresh air. Really gets my wanderlust in overdrive and tickles my brain in the nicest way imaginable. As a famous Philosopher once said \"Life without music would be a mistake.\" I wholeheartedly agree with that statement, for me since I've first heard this song, I love a lot of songs, too many if I'm being honest but this one is special it plays to that wonderful aspect of my being who never grew out of that childlike sense of wonder. I don't know how and I don't know why but Shawn Mendes and his music has always been near and dear to my heart and I'm forever grateful to live at the same time as this guy and hear all of the wonderful things he can make.",

John 14:9-11 - Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father? (Read More...) John 14:26 | View whole chapter | See verse in context But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. John 16:7 | View whole chapter | See verse in context Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. GOD is spirit being in 3 and so HE created man - who is also created in 3 (SPIRIT and SOUL 1st and BODY last). 3 parts = ONE GOD. Humans: one human = 3 parts. Pure logic and all cleared out. The BIBLE is clear and true, yet still many amongst us ask these 2 questions: IS EARTH TRULY FLAT? GOD IN 3? - WHAT THAT MEANS? \r\n\r\nGOD created a BODY (FLESHLY BODY) to HIMSELF to come among us as one of us to: TO REDEEM US AND SET AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO LIVE.\r\nAbout A - C : as we know satan is a copier - therefore he also creates a body to himself, for he cannot create as GOD can, therefore his /satan`s/ body is A.I. But what matters is: WHO LIVES INSIDE THAT BODY WE TALK ABOUT: JESUS CHRIST = THE BODY OF GOD AND A.C = THE BODY OF SATAN. Again, LOGIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nWere is the COMFORETER? whom should come and help out? Why some of you still haven`t received HIM? - that you still ask questions that BIBLE has clearly answered.\r\nfather, son, and husband. - these = titles that we can carrie as we live out our lives on earth. \r\nSPIRIT + SOUL + BODY = COMPLETE MAN AKA LIVING SOUL. (HUMAN = A CONSCIOUS SPIRIT). In DEATH we lose our carnal body, we do not lose soul nor spirit. We are SPIRIT BEINGS also, created before received earthly bodies. (that`s why there`s saying: LIFE IS A GIFT) - we cant give a gift to someone who dose not exist. To receive a gift, one must exist. \r\nWe were created before our bodies, in spirit? - yes: Jeremiah 1:5 | View whole chapter | See verse in context Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.\r\nJames 2:26 | View whole chapter | See verse in context For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also. 1 Corinthians 15:44 | View whole chapter | See verse in context It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body. \r\nEcclesiastes 3:20 | View whole chapter | See verse in context All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again. \r\n2 Corinthians 12:3 | View whole chapter | See verse in context And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)\r\n\r\nPhilippians 3:21 | View whole chapter | See verse in context Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself. \r\n2 Corinthians 12:2 | View whole chapter | See verse in context I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.\r\n\r\nMatthew 10:28 | View whole chapter | See verse in context And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. 1 John 4:2 | View whole chapter | See verse in context Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: Romans 8:9 | View whole chapter | See verse in context But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. 1 Corinthians 2:12 | View whole chapter | See verse in context Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. Romans 8:16 | View whole chapter | See verse in context The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: Ecclesiastes 12:7 | View whole chapter | See verse in context Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy are we denying the 3 parts of GOD and humans if all 3 parts are real? All that matters is SPIRIT AND SPIRITS.\r\n\r\nAnd can`t any of you read? Clearly a SPIRIT IN 3 , CREATED SPIRITS IN 3s. (GOD CREATED HUMANS).",

It wasn\u2019t the ocean,\u2014\ntoo far.\nIt was the keys of my piano. \nfloating around my mind like scattered stars\u2014and my mind too.\nDivided, in every way I could imagine\u2014\nA spiraling fit of madness,\nYet the world\u2014\nthis world of painted-halves\u2014\nIt feels more finished when I dream.\n\nI wonder\u2026. \n\nWhen I dream, \nwhere do I go? \nDo I fall? \nDo We fall? \nLike stars\u2014\nacross the sky, \nand to where? \nTo whom?\n\nDo we always\u2014end up here? \nWhere is here?\u2014Who are we\u2014Who am I?\nAll I know\u2014that which I do not,\nBut, consistently and very persistently.\n\nI transpire\u2014a moon-flower, \nprovided the regard of an ambivalent and ephemeral white of a bloom, \nnocturnal apropos the sun, \nprimordially adjoining the reputed crepuscule we bare upon the night,\nlying veiled betwixt the celerity of August and an ever-bewildering, yet paradoxically-convoluted October sky\u2014\n\nSeptember.\n\nI ended up here.\nAnd, surrounded by all of my half-paintings.\n\nAnyone else? I mean, what is that?\n\nI wonder\u2026\n\nand I\u2019m still in wonder.",

I\u2019m so not up to do that, besides that your concert was amazing and I for sure was not expecting this song to be there! (NEITHER was my sister) anyways keep your spirit and know you have lots of love from friends family and fans! \ud83d\ude18\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\u2764\ufe0f Edit:like a couple seconds   later:\nStitches is an amazing song and the date of your concert here in Canada was July 4th and my birthday is July 9 that\u2019s why I said a birthday gift from my father. Anyways I\u2019m trying to keep this short but I know none of this is. Have a good day or night love you (even the people reading this) edit: 2 mins after 1st edit  \nHow is he jumping backwards and landing just fine did he stop the scene to somehow land or did he break a million bones?

It captured me quickly and I found myself listening intently to the words he was saying rather than just treating this song as background music. I'm listening to this song again and finding more things to be impressed with, like his vocals! Added this to a few of my playlists and am looking forward to more of his music!!",

This video feels very fluid and cohesive, it all comes together very cleanly.\n\nThe lyrics in this song are very good, some parts feel kind of generic to me, like the \"I wonder if you feel it too. I wonder what it's like to be loved by you.\" But that isn't because generic, but rather, it's a relatable situation to be in!\n\nThe sound production and instrumentals feel great and well handled, but I'm not a music expert so I couldn't honestly tell you!\n\nScore:10/10",
