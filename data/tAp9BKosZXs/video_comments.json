First, it's important to have a strong sense of personal style and a keen eye for trends. You'll want to stay up-to-date on the latest fashion news and developments and keep an eye on what other designers are doing.\n\nNext, you'll need to develop your technical skills. This may involve taking courses in pattern-making, sewing, and other aspects of fashion design. You may also want to consider getting a degree in fashion design or a related field.\n\nOnce you have the skills and knowledge you need, you can start creating your own designs. This may involve working on your own or collaborating with others, depending on your preferences and goals.\n\nUltimately, the key to becoming a successful fashion designer is to stay passionate and dedicated to your craft. With hard work, creativity, and a willingness to learn and grow, you can achieve your dreams and make your mark in the world of fashion.",

Now, there are plenty of exclusively lgbtq artists out there who have long normalized bi/homosexuality to the point where it's not just a media movement anymore \ud83d\ude42 The way KP portrays bisexuality in this song is still full of negative connotations full of unneeded guilt and shame. Not affirming at all. I'm glad that 14 years has made a huge difference and we now have artists like Hayley Kiyoko and Halsey \ud83d\ude0a",
