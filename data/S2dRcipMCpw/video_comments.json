She used to read the Exorcist on the way to school. Laughing about how Reagan (She's the ONE.) got it really badd. NO! Really, really badly. Puking tapioca pudding or something to that effect. Speaking of Reagan and that, Did not the president I mean, something about that Star Wars at the bar band and Luke Skywalker with a blaster strapped on. That ain't the Muppets tunes. I jist cain't quite place where I heard that in the song of Billie's. (Y'all.) Sorry... What I am driving at is how Billie Eilish did a show at Penn State. The ONE MIND there ain't \"you're\" self... Something about like, they all pull together as a team. (Them are.) The Cars/Traffick... Definitely stuck. A person can hear the pistons scraping... Something about like, you may be a lover but you ain't no dancer, as well as jumpin' jack flash... Poltergeists and \"talkoes\". (I believe it may be the B Y Uttes, actually. Those Latter Day Saints.) Well, Good Will Hunting... Phil Collins could not find it either way back when... So, do not worry, that is just the way it is.",

        "text": "Hello there! To the one reading this, a blessed day. I just want to share the good news of salvation.\n\nEven if You feel that You are alone and no one cares for you, Someone cares and loves You unconditionally. His name is the LORD GOD who created you and me\u2014who knows everything about us, every pain, every failure, every struggle and every hurt in us. He is there and He wants to be a Father to you. However, the reality is GOD is perfect and He is holy but we are sinners for we sinned against Him and against others. As GOD is a God of justice, He is against sin and so we cannot save ourselves by our own power because of our fallen nature. Nevertheless, as GOD loves us so much and desires to reconcile us to Himself, He descended from Heaven and took the form of man. He is the Lord JESUS who lived His life without sin because He himself is GOD. Him being the perfect sacrificial lamb, He was crucified to take on the punishment that was meant for us sinners. He died for You and me. But death cannot hold the Lord JESUS because He doesn't deserve death for He did not sin and so now reigns in heaven. By accepting the Lord JESUS as your personal Lord and Savior, you receive His sacrifice and so your sins will be forgiven by the LORD. The Lord JESUS loves you and if You come to Him regardless of Your past, He can renew you. He is able to wash our sins clean by His precious blood. You can come to Him. \n\nFor GOD so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life.\nJohn 3:16",

        "text": "*Imagine, if you died right now; where would your soul go for eternity? Was everything you ever did, without purpose, and never really mattered; or will you just stop existing, after you draw your last breath? Think about this carefully, it is the most important question of your life. There is only one chance to get it right, and it is in this lifetime. Do not be deceived: God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. Heaven is real; place of eternal bliss, peace, joy, and perfection. Hell is real; place of eternal suffering, torment, despair, and agony. You\u2019re going to spend your eternity, in one of those places. God's will is, that nobody would perish. One day; each and every one of us, must appear before The Judgement Seat of The Holy Righteous God, and to give an account, how we have lived our lives. The only way to get to Heaven is, if you\u2019ve never broken any part of The God\u2019s Law, in other words, if you\u2019re without sin; and every single one of us have sinned, and fall short of The Glory of God. Not one person, who\u2019s not born again from above, of The Holy Spirit of God, and is still in their sins; can not inherit The Kingdom of God; for the wages of sin is death, and eternal damnation: Our sins separates us from God. It is appointed for every single person, to die once: After that; comes The Judgement, of The Holy Almighty God.*\n\n*But The Heavenly Father in His love and mercy, sent His only begotten Son; Jesus Christ, to atone for our sins: He left Heaven\u2019s Throne, was God in flesh, conceived by The Holy Spirit, born of a virgin; lived a holy perfect life, while being in same temptations as we are, yet without sin; was condemned unjustly to death, although being innocent; was beaten, mocked, flogged, and crucified on the cross, and gave up His life and Blood willingly on our behalf; for there is no forgiveness of sins, without the shedding of blood: But Christ; The Spotless and Unblemished Lamb of God, The Final Perfect Sacrifice once and for all; took the punishment of our sins on the cross, sacrificed Himself for us, and paid the sin debt in full; past, present, and future; so we can be forgiven of all our sins, and be redeemed back to God; after the fall in Paradise, by satan's tempting; through The Holy Precious Blood, which Jesus shed on the middle cross at Golgotha; in His everlasting love, towards every single one of us.*\n\n*If you truly change your mind from your unbelief towards The Lord Jesus Christ, The Holy One of Israel; and believe, have faith, and trust, with all your heart; that Jesus Christ of Nazareth, The King Messiah; The only begotten Son, of The one and only True Living God; was crucified on the middle cross at Golgotha, died on the cross for our sins, was buried, rose from the dead by God\u2019s power on the third day, according to The Holy Bible, and by faith receive Him as your personal Lord and Savior; through The Holy Royal Blood of The Lord Jesus Christ; you will be saved, and are born again from above, of The Holy Spirit of God. Every sin, that weighs down your inner being; even the ones, you never dare to speak of; will be forgiven. Change your mind from your unbelief towards The Lord Jesus Christ, believe The Gospel, follow The Lord Jesus Christ; and you will spend your eternity in Heaven, with our Holy Almighty God; where is no more death, sorrow, pain nor crying.*\n\n*John 3:16 \u2013 For God so loved the world; that He gave His only begotten Son, (Jesus Christ); that whoever believes in Him; will not perish (in Hell); but have everlasting life (in Heaven).*\n\n*John 14:6 \u2013 The Lord Jesus Christ; said to him: ''I am The Way, The Truth, and The Life: No one comes to The Father (in Heaven); but by Me.''*\n\n*John 6:47 \u2013 (The Lord Jesus Christ; said to them:) ''Most assuredly, I say to you: He, that believes in Me; has everlasting life.''*\n\n*John 3:3 \u2013 The Lord Jesus Christ answered; and said to him: ''Most assuredly, I say to you: Except someone is born again (from above, of The Holy Spirit of God); he cannot see The Kingdom of God.''*\n\n*1. John 5:12 \u2013 He, who has The (only begotten) Son (of God, Jesus Christ); has (everlasting) life: And he, who does has not have The Son of God; has not (everlasting) life. **_(Religion or churches, is not what saves us: Salvation is a Person; our Lord and our God: Jesus Christ. We have connection to The Father God; through His Son, Jesus Christ; in The Holy Spirit. It is not about being outwardly religious: It is; that everyone of us, would have a personal relationship with God.)_*\n\n*The Book of Acts 4:12 \u2013 Nor is there salvation in any other: For there is no other name under Heaven given among men, (only The Lord Jesus Christ), which we must be saved.*\n\n*Romans 10:9 \u2013 That if you confess with your mouth The Lord Jesus; and believe in your heart, that God has raised Him from the dead; you will be saved.*\n\n*Romans 10:13 \u2013 For whoever calls on the Name of The LORD (Jesus Christ); will be saved.*\n\n*Romans 8:1-2 \u2013 There is therefore now no condemnation to them, who are in Christ Jesus; (who are born again from above; of The Holy Spirit of God): For the law of The Spirit of life, in Christ Jesus: Has made me free; from the law of sin, and death.*\n\n*Romans 5:1 \u2013 Therefore, being justified by faith: We have peace with God; through our Lord, Jesus Christ.*\n\n*Ephesians 2:8-10 \u2013 For it is by grace, you have been saved, through faith; and that not of yourselves; it is The Gift of God: Not of works; so no one can boast. For we are God\u2019s workmanship, created in Christ Jesus; for good works, which God has prepared beforehand; that we should walk in them. **_(According to The Holy Bible: Salvation is completely, entirely, and 100%; by belief, faith, and trust, in The Lord Jesus Christ, by His mercy, and His finished Work of The Cross; God sees us worthy in Christ. Not one of us have lived, and will not live completely sinless; even after being born again: Only The Lord Jesus Christ lived a perfect sinless life, and fullfilled The Law perfectly. We can not earn salvation by our good deeds, and we are not kept saved by our good deeds. God has given us free will, how faithfully we want to follow Him. Forsaking sins is absolutely God\u2019s will, but sometimes it can take a long time, and if we continue to live in sin on purpose, and intentionally: We will reap, what we sow; but God is yet merciful, and longsuffering. Even if we are bound by alcohol, drugs, lust, homosexuality, or any other sin; but we believe, have faith, and trust, with all our heart and soul in Jesus Christ, as our Lord and Savior; We don\u2019t have even the smallest fear Hell; but access to Heaven, thanks to our Lord, Jesus Christ: For Christ\u2019s Holy Divine Blood, has washed all our sins away; and we have been sealed, secured, and sanctified eternally, with The God\u2019s Holy Spirit of promise; which quarantees our inheritance, of The Kingdom of The Merciful, Holy, Almighty God. Belief, faith, and trust, in The Lord Jesus Christ + nothing else = Salvation.)_*\n\n*Titus 3:5 \u2013 Not by works of righteousness, which we have done; but according to His mercy: The Lord Jesus Christ saved us; by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of The Holy Spirit.*\n\n*Romans 5:8 \u2013 But God demonstrates His great love toward us, in that; while we were still sinners: The Lord Jesus Christ died for us.*\n\n*Isaiah 1:18 \u2013 ''Come now, and let us reason together. ''Says The LORD (Jesus Christ: The Merciful, Almighty God): ''Though your sins are like scarlet; they will be as white as snow: Though they are red like crimson; they will be as wool.''*\n\n*1. Timothy 2:5 \u2013 For there is one God, (God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob), (Jacob = Israel), and one Mediator, between God and men: The Man Christ Jesus. **_(There is only one God, in three different Persons: The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit. This is called; The Holy Trinity, or; The Holy Tri Unity. There are not three different Gods: But only one God; in three different Persons.)_*\n\n*The Book of Revelation 1:8 \u2013 (The Lord Jesus Christ; The Lion of Judah; said:) ''I am The Alpha, and The Omega; The Beginning, and The Ending.'' Says The Lord God: ''Who is, and who was, and who is to come: The Almighty.'' (The King of Kings, and Lord of Lords: The Most High God)*\n\n*1. Peter 5:8 \u2013 Be sober minded, be vigilant: Because your adversary; the devil, (or satan, which means; accuser, or adversary); walks about, like a roaring lion: Seeking; whom he may devour.*\n\n*John 10:10 \u2013 (The Lord Jesus Christ; The Prince of Peace; said:) ''The thief, (satan), does not come; except to steal, to kill, and to destroy: I have come, that they may have life; and that they may have it more abundantly.''*\n\n*Ephesians 6:12 \u2013For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood; but against principalities; against powers; against the rulers, of the darkness of this world; against the spiritual forces of evil, in the heavenly places.*\n\n*Isaiah 41:10 \u2013 (The Lord Jesus Christ; The God of The Heavenly Armies; said:) ''Do not be afraid; for I am with you: Do not be intimidated; for I am your God: I will strengthen you, yes; I will help you: I will uphold you, with My righteous right hand.''*\n\n*Isaiah 54:10 \u2013 ''For the mountains may depart, and the hills may be removed: But My unfailing love for you; will never be shaken: And My Covenant of Peace; will never be removed.'' Says the LORD; who has mercy on you.''*\n\n*The Book of Revelation 22:12 \u2013 (The Lord Jesus Christ: The Maker of all, and everything; that ever exists, that has ever existed, and that will ever exist: The Holy Almighty God; said:) ''And, behold; I come quickly, and My reward is with Me: To give every man; according, as his work shall be.''*\n\n*The LORD bless you, and keep you; The LORD make His face shine upon you, and be gracious to you; The LORD lift up His countenance upon you, and give you peace; In Jesus Christ\u2019s Holy, Royal, Merciful, All Powerful, and Mighty Name, Amen.*",
