        "text": "The Weekend acaba de se tornar o artista mais escutado do Spotify. Primeiro lugar no MUNDO! O \u00fanico a bater 100 milh\u00f5es de ouvintes mensal. O cara morou na rua, filho de imigrantes, negro, inspirador e de uma criatividade jamais vista! A revista Rolling Stones em 2021, diz em uma mat\u00e9ria nomeada \u201cPor que amamos tanto The Weeknd\u201d que ele pensa fora da casinha, tem originalidade melanc\u00f3lica \u00e9 que suas letras transmitem sentimentos de nostalgia, conseguem passar a dor dele com as refer\u00eancias da sua vida, da vida da fama e duas consequ\u00eancias e ainda carregam peso mesmo nas can\u00e7\u00f5es de amor. Uma mistura de R&B e Hip Hop Que com um toque de pimenta e sensualidade, faz dele um dos artistas mais criativos, completos e original. Ningu\u00e9m faz nada parecido com The Weeknd. Eu n\u00e3o diria que ele se compara a Michel Jackson, mas ele carrega uma energia muito parecida dentro da personalidade e da proposta dele. Suas m\u00fasicas n\u00e3o s\u00e3o Pop ent\u00e3o n\u00e3o pode ser comparada com Michel. A todos que tem uma oportunidade de ir a seu Show da Turn\u00ea After Hours , recomendo muito. Fui, e foi um espet\u00e1culo de arrepiar. E posso dizer que me senti diante de um rei da m\u00fasica e produ\u00e7\u00e3o. No futuro vamos falar muito dele. Porque ele realmente tudo que toca e cria vira sucesso, fazendo dele um artista com potencial pra fazer historia! After Hours j\u00e1 foi o seu marco hist\u00f3rico , ainda vira muito mais!",

        "text": "\"THE IDOL\" must have been inspired by the Jabba the Hut & Slave Leia scene from \"Return of the Jedi\". Only the most hopelessly obsequious woke enabler would ever consider the bloated and boring weak end to be sexy and seductive. Watch him trying to rock a trenchcoat. It's laughable yet we're supposed to think he's slick. It's easy to be a hustler when the bleeding heart big shots have been brainwashed into believing that they owe you stardom. Anybody else spouting such cheesy porn talk would have been rightfully dismissed as a clown pervert. It must be sweet to have the system so thoroughly rigged on your behalf that the world is forced to accept the preposterous premise that the unwatchable weak end is some badass super stud, lest we be found guilty of violating some PC dogma.\n\nPart of the time, 'THE IDOL\" wants to be a satire poking fun at the usual show biz phonies and flunkies. But then it pretends to shine a harsh spotlight on the sleaziness of the music industry, while at the same time celebrating the sleaze. Back in the seventies, nobody cared about the sleaze because the music was great. But then MTV and madonna took over and the quality of the music became irrelevant. The MTV boom era faded away a long time ago, but the music industry is still stuck in the tired and tiresome post-madonna paradigm of bubblegum narcissism. Why? A TV series that answers that question would be worth watching.\n\n\nhttp://www.reverbnation.com/QANEIDA",

Hes got so much more to offer than just standing/sitting around looking at a woman dancing. Its like when he was with Ariana Grande. He just looked pushed to the side. Like he wasnt in charge of the project and just got his creativity suppressed. I hope his next project he kicks ass and shows his talents like he did in the red suit project.",
