This is what the Bible says about it.. \r\n\"The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil. They will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\" Matt 13: 41-42\r\nJesus Christ is the only way to heaven \"I am the way, the truth, and the life no one comes to the father but by me.\"  John 14:6   Ask God to reveal this to you- He will! \r\n\"For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.\" Romans 3:23 ADMIT THAT YOU'RE A SINNER. We've all broken God's laws and ten commandments.. \"Thou shalt not lie, steal, covet, dishonor parents, take God's name in vain..\"(Exodus 20) We do not have righteousness on our own to get to heaven, \"God made him (Jesus) who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.\" 2 Cor. 5:21 Godly sorrow leads to genuine repentance for sinning against the righteous God and there is a change of heart, we change our mind and God changes our hearts and regenerates us from the inside out. God is deadly serious about sin, when we genuinely repent we hate sin just as God hates it, and we turn away from it.\r\n\"But God commended His love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us.\" Romans 5:8 BELIEVE IN YOUR HEART THAT JESUS CHRIST DIED FOR YOUR SINS, WAS BURIED, AND THAT GOD RAISED JESUS FROM THE DEAD. This is trusting with all of your heart that Jesus Christ is who he said he was. He saves us from sin and hell and brings us into a relationship with him. We become God's children. We are saved from hell, eternal death.\r\n\"For whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.\" Rom 10:13 CALL UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD. Every single person who ever lived since Adam will bend their knee and confess with their mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, the Lord of Lords and the King of Kings.\r\nRead the Bible, Walk with the Lord and give your life to Him!",
