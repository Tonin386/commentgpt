At first I thought it was going to be about big sky Montana, but it was about the ocean floor.\nI like it.\nHonestly it's sort of complex. I'm not sure what it's suppose to be about, but I'm sure you have your reasons.\n\nI could definitely see this playing in a gift shop. In both Montana & along the California coast. Gift shop music. It's perfect.\n\nYou are a handsome, special guy John Mayer.\ud83d\udc96",

And now she's like going crazy on her Twitter. Being dramatic and saying \"gonna listen to Dear John for a while to neutralize her head\" or something. \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude02\n\nSaw another similar tweet from another Swiftie about the song \"Waiting on the World to Change\"\n\nYup, Swifties.
