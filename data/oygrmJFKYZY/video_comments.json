This is one sweet, strong, fun loving woman! Who would want to leave that?! \ud83d\ude02 For a second I thought the guy who messed up and regret it now was one of my kids daddy's.  That is when I laughed instead of crying. I reminded myself that they're not all the same guy! Thank you! This video has me loving this song now! Ooooh, I'm a sucker for any lovely lady who can knock someone on they're ass like that! ;)",
