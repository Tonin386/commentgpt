The song takes on new meaning for me now though, since my cousin has passed. So yeah, very emotional. Still hauntingly beautiful. \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffe",

But being naive and trusting my loved ones I believed in my heart they would never want to bring me harm or pain. 20 some years later I\u2019m an addict still trying to quit. It feels like a trap was set and I took the bait by trying to hang on to my family. Biggest mistake of my life. I loved them and would have followed them anywhere now I got trust issues and I\u2019m all alone because of all this happened. But live and learn I guess\u2026",

Just a few more years. Then I\u2019ll finally jump off that bridge with cherry blossoms at the bottom. So I can die peacefully.",
