        "text": "The first comment under this song said when John Mayer\u2019s back with long hair you know the album\u2019s going to be epic. In response to this remark. I disagree to an extent. True talent has absolutely nothing to do with a musician\u2019s age, race, sexual orientation, religion, appearance, or anything else! What does matter, and the ONLY thing that does, is that the person has talent - nothing more! No matter what John looks like, he is, and always will be, a great artist imo! I\u2019m 67 years old now and was trained as a classical pianist and organist since I was 5. I learned at a very young age that a person can learn how to read notes and play them, and/or sing them, on an instrument, but that doesn\u2019t mean they can make music \u2018come to life\u2019 like Mayer can! This has to come from deep within the person\u2019s heart and soul, and this is what makes him a gifted artist.",

        "text": "Nice I guess. I was in high school at the beginning of the 80's but all I hear in this song is Keyboard percussion and guitar solo ripped off straight from TOTO. Being a guitar player and Musician myself I usually hope for some creativity and originality rather than rehashing great work from the past. Toto as a band was a group of  incredible musicians. Plus  I don't know who put him in Johnny Depps costume and hair style from 21 Jump street but there is such a thing as paying ode to something and a bit different just recycling. Look I grew up on the music of the late 70's and early 80's seeing a lot of these bands live like the Police, Clash, Black flag and this list goes on and on but the 80's wasn't just the soft rock of MJ, and many others. There was real new music being pushed forward in the late 70's and early 80's. Nostalgia is one thing but when I can recognize easy the keyboard and percussion multitrack loop that actually was the first of its kind at that point then your ripping off half the song Africa by Toto. John Mayer your a lot more talented than this.",

Everyone wanted to keep Depp in a box and he constantly took strange rolls to escape from the persona of the pretty boy as well.",
