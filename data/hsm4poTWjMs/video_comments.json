We want one on one action. Making love is fine, vanilla sex is fine, but sometimes you got to change things up in a couple. YouTube is misogynistic. I find or nah offensive, change the lyrics to that song. It\u2019s our WAP, what we do with it, it\u2019s our business, Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion never let men tell you to do with your music or anything unless you ladies want to. This song is female empowerment and we own our pussies and don\u2019t tell us what to do with it. It\u2019s 2023!. I like the original version. Dick doesn\u2019t run me, I run dick. You the bitch. Female empowerment all the way. Female should be empowering each other, not tearing us down. Free speech ladies and we are allow to think what we want. Support each other, please.",

        "text": "It is inarguable that music has the capacity to inspire, provoke, and move its listeners, sometimes in ways that no other medium can. Cardi B's controversial single, \"WAP\" featuring Megan Thee Stallion, serves as a perfect testament to this power. The song, while not universally acclaimed as the \"best\" by all measures, has made significant waves in the music industry and society at large due to its candid representation of female sexuality, its stirring lyrics, and its groundbreaking performance.\n\n\"WAP,\" which stands for 'Wet-Ass P***y,' sparked immediate conversation upon its release in August 2020. The song's unapologetic and explicit lyrical content about female sexual empowerment and pleasure was, for many, a breath of fresh air in an industry that often objectifies women or reduces them to the subjects of male desire. Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion, through their unabashed articulation of female sexuality, effectively dismantled the norms and created a new, empowering narrative that resonated with many women around the world. This boldness alone serves as a unique selling point for the song's reputation as one of the greatest.\n\nLyrically, \"WAP\" is riddled with innuendos, metaphors, and bold proclamations that keep listeners engaged from start to finish. The choice of words, while explicit, is both humorous and creative, illustrating Cardi B's and Megan's knack for crafting memorable verses. The song's lyrics, combined with the catchy hook, create an infectious rhythm that's hard to forget, contributing to its widespread popularity.\n\nBeyond its lyrics, \"WAP\" stands out for its high-energy performance. Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion deliver their verses with confidence and swagger that command attention. The accompanying music video, an opulent spectacle filled with colorful, imaginative sets and stunning choreography, further highlights the song's audacious spirit. The video has garnered over a billion views on YouTube, a testament to its captivating visual appeal and the song's overall influence.\n\nThe impact of \"WAP\" extends beyond the realm of music. The song incited widespread dialogue about sexuality, consent, and the role of women in society. It inspired think pieces, social media challenges, and even political debates, marking its place as a significant cultural moment. This ability to permeate public consciousness and spark such a wide range of responses cements \"WAP's\" position as a standout piece in recent music history.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that a song's greatness often lies in the eye (or ear) of the beholder. Some listeners may find \"WAP's\" explicit content off-putting or argue that it lacks the musical complexity found in other genres or pieces. Others may laud it as a fearless anthem of female empowerment. Therefore, while it might not universally be accepted as the \"best\" song ever, \"WAP's\" cultural impact, its bold articulation of female sexuality, its memorable lyrics, and its overall popularity make it a significant and noteworthy piece in contemporary music.\n\nIn conclusion, the greatness of \"WAP\" lies not just in its artistic merit but also in its societal impact. It serves as a reminder that music can be more than just a form of entertainment\u2014it can also be a powerful platform for challenging norms, fostering conversations, and empowering listeners.\n\n\ud83d\uddff",

        "text": "So she won a Grammy for this song. Wow, I remember when a rap group came out and rap almost got banned in the USA. Seriously that rap group was 2 Live Crew. \n    2 Live Crew was way ahead of their time. Had they came out with the album Banned in the U.S.A today, there's no telling. I think 2 Live Crew would have stole the entire show. Hell they wouldn't even have to sing the clean version on TV. \n    Back when I was a kid in the mid to late 80s, a tv station would be in a world of trouble if someone even said ass in the wrong context. They better be talking about a farm animal is all I can say. \n   My wife was watching Pluto TV just last night and Gordon Ramsey was dropping the F bomb every other word!!! I asked her if she was watching the show on HBO or Showtime? She turns to me and says no and asked why? I said well he is cussing more than I do and yet you have the volume barring so loud our neighbors can't think straight. \n   Times have changed and to tell you the truth, I kinda miss those old days growing up. Time was a little more simpler. My grandfather worked a 8 to 4:30 job five days a week. He wasn't rich and he wasn't poor either. He worked 40 hours a week and had a beautiful home, 2 vehicles a car for grandma and a pickup truck for him. Then on top of all that, he was able to retire at 60 years old. Unfortunately he died before he could turn 62. So he didn't get to enjoy his retirement and that really sucks. That man fought in 2 wars and how he made it out of D-Day is a miracle on itself. \n   Anyway sorry I'm pretty sure you don't want to read all that. Take care and God Speed to you and your family",
