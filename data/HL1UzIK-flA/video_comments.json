Reach us all, God, with your wisdom, your strength, and your fortitude. Teach us all, God, ways to connect with one another that does not use physical, mental, emotional or spiritual violence. Give us life-giving words and actions.1\nMultiply the grace to endure and may they find encouragement, assurance and hope in the knowledge that however intense their trials and troubles, they are but for a moment, but will produce in them a glory that vastly outweighs the present torment they are enduring, knowing that they are participants in the suffering of their Saviour.2\nGentle Jesus, shepherd of peace, join to your own suffering the pain of all who have been hurt in body, mind, and spirit by those who betrayed the trust placed in them.3\nHere are three Scripture verses you can pray: 1 \u201cHe pulled me out of a dangerous pit, out of the deadly quicksand. He set me safely on a rock and made me secure.\u201d Psalm 40:2 2 \u201cYou have changed my sadness into a joyful dance; you have taken away my sorrow and surrounded me with joy.\u201d Psalm 30:11 3 \u201cHe forgives all my sins and heals all my diseases. ...\n\nHere are some examples of occult prayers1:\nLet the sword of the God of Elijah arise against every occultic power and citadel of darkness assigned against my life, in the name of Jesus.\nMy Father, redeem me from the powers of the sword, in the name of Jesus.\nHere are some prayer points for praying against occultism2:\nPray for God's light to reveal Satan's lies and his hold on Occultists' lives.\nPray for strategically-placed believers to share God's love with Occultists.\nPray for Occultists to experience the power of Him who raised Jesus from the dead. It is well with you. :) X God Bless R",

We pray for restoration and peace We pray for fortitude in the face of fear and that we might do what is right and just.\nDaniel",

        "text": "\ud83c\udfb6 \"Work\" by Rihanna ft. Drake - A Hypnotic Blend of Rhythm and Chemistry \ud83c\udfb6\r\n\r\n\"Work\" is a dynamic collaboration between Rihanna and Drake that pulses with an irresistible energy. From the moment the beat drops, the song commands your attention and lures you into its magnetic rhythm.\r\n\r\nRihanna's vocals exude a sultry confidence, intertwining seamlessly with Drake's verses to create a captivating dialogue. Their undeniable chemistry adds a layer of intimacy to the track, making the lyrics feel like a private conversation between two people navigating the complexities of attraction.\r\n\r\nThe music video's vibrant visuals mirror the song's infectious vibe, immersing you in a world where music and movement are inextricably linked. The choreography's raw sensuality adds an extra layer of depth to the song's themes of desire and connection.\r\n\r\n\"Work\" doesn't just provide a catchy melody; it also taps into the universal language of body language and emotion. The lyrics might be explicit, but they also reflect the unspoken desires that can exist between two people.\r\n\r\nUltimately, \"Work\" is a celebration of rhythm, chemistry, and the primal pull that music has on our bodies and souls. Rihanna and Drake's collaboration has resulted in a song that's impossible not to move to, and its impact on pop culture continues to resonate. \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd7a\ud83c\udfb5",
