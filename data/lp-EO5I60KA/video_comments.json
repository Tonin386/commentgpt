We did mysteriously fall in love; I met my wife in a public house called The Old House at Home, and when I asked if my now wife would come home with me, her first question to Maureen, the landlady who now runs the Spread Eagle was \"Is he an axe murderer?\" Thankfully, the answer was no, and twenty-seven years later, we are nearly twenty years married on 5th December this year, and I have never loved my wife more. My wife is bedridden, recovering from Heart Failure, and fragile from problems with my wife's lungs and kidneys in Ward 16 Diabetes at Burton Queens Hospital. I wish that my wife's legs worked like they used to, and the day I could once again sweep my wife off her feet. \"Thinking Out Loud\" is our life song, and my wife and I will be eternally grateful for your brilliance. And I always tell my wife, \"I am\". \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc95\u2764\u200d\ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udfbc\ud83c\udfb5\ud83c\udfb6\ud83c\udfa7\ud83c\udfa4\ud83c\udf99\ud83e\udd1f\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4d",

La chanson parle d'un amour qui dure dans le temps, \u00e0 travers toutes les joies, les peines et les changements de la vie. La chanson aborde les diff\u00e9rentes fa\u00e7ons dont les gens peuvent tomber amoureux, ainsi que l'id\u00e9e que cet amour restera fort quoi qu'il arrive. La chanson encourage l'auditeur \u00e0 garder la t\u00eate sur le c\u0153ur de son amoureux et \u00e0 penser \u00e0 voix haute, permettant \u00e0 l'amour de circuler librement.",

        "text": "Ao doce rapaz de \"olhos raivosos\" e repleto de bondade caso leia esta mensagem algum dia, saiba de algo que emerge de meu ser:\nAh, \u00e0s vezes n\u00e3o temos como esquecer, pois as \"mem\u00f3rias do calabou\u00e7o\" precisam ser acessadas. A verdade \u00e9 que NADA trouxemos para o mundo e nada podemos levar dele. Por isso devemos criar boas lembran\u00e7as e momentos agrad\u00e1veis com as pessoas que amamos, e eu escolho minha fam\u00edlia verdadeira e saber a toda a verdade. Eu n\u00e3o sei o significado das cores mas eu sempre escolho o PRETO.\r\nOutra, coisa eu sempre amarei a \u00e1rea de ci\u00eancia jur\u00eddica, ci\u00eancia pol\u00edtica, sociologia, filosofia, literatura que edifique o intelecto, pois o conhecimento e o campo do saber liberta. A educa\u00e7\u00e3o, os livros e todos os nossos valores morais, \u00e9ticos e espirituais nos faz angariar voos maiores. Eu escolho ser eu mesma, pois tenho orgulho de ser boa, doce e am\u00e1vel e apesar de todas as injusti\u00e7as que fizeram comigo eu ainda conservo a bondade em meu ser, pois n\u00e3o podemos abrir o nosso cora\u00e7\u00e3o para o mal. A verdade \u00e9 que eu jamais faria mal a mim mesma e tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o quero fazer mal a ningu\u00e9m. Seres humanos n\u00e3o s\u00e3o experimentos cient\u00edficos, pois maior do que o poder da ci\u00eancia \u00e9 o poder de Deus, do amor, da gra\u00e7a, do perd\u00e3o, da generosidade, da simplicidade, da humanidade, da gentileza, dos pequenos gestos de afeto. Minha natureza n\u00e3o \u00e9 para o mal e particularmente eu escolho ser boa mas confesso que queria entender o porque de terem feito tanta maldade contra a mim. N\u00e3o se pode engendrar armadilhas contra as pessoas, nem tampouco fazer mal a algu\u00e9m e agir ardilosamente para prejudic\u00e1-la. A trapa\u00e7a n\u00e3o \u00e9 algo de Deus, pois n\u00e3o podemos fazer mal a algu\u00e9m e depois imputar isto a aquela pessoa que sofreu todas as injusti\u00e7as. E querer que algu\u00e9m seja burra o suficiente para acreditar ser poss\u00edvel algu\u00e9m fazer mal a si mesmo para depois denunciar a si pr\u00f3pria com a finalidade de ser mantida em uma \"pris\u00e3o\". \u00c9 \u00f3bvio que se trata de uma trapa\u00e7a. A verdade, \u00e9 que desconfio de tudo o que me dizem, pois infelizmente descobri que tudo isto foi um \"castelo de mentiras\" como no \"show de Truman\", onde Truman n\u00e3o era mentiroso mas todos mentiam para ele. Bem, realmente h\u00e1 lugares e pessoas que sabemos que n\u00e3o \u00e9 para n\u00f3s. E tudo isto eu sei que n\u00e3o \u00e9 bom para mim. A verdade \u00e9 que eu escolho voltar para casa, voltar para Deus. Eu perdoo todos os que me machucaram e n\u00e3o lhes desejo mal por\u00e9m jamais assumirei o que n\u00e3o fiz. Repito, \"olhos de raiva\" e recheado de bondade jamais faria mal a mim mesma para depois denunciar a mim mesma e ser \"mantida prisioneira\". O fato \u00e9 que eu n\u00e3o tenho voca\u00e7\u00e3o para contracenar \"A bela e a Fera\", pois acredito que amor pressup\u00f5e liberdade. Eu escolho LIBERDADE. Eu escolho minha fam\u00edlia verdadeira e jamais renunciaria a minha liberdade para viver nenhum amor em uma pris\u00e3o, pois acredito piamente no ide\u00e1rio da Revolu\u00e7\u00e3o Francesa que nos incentiva a um viver melhor, a saber: liberdade, igualdade e fraternidade. Caso haja um \"vidro\", ele precisa ser quebrado e a pris\u00e3o precisa ser aberta, a \"brincadeira\" foi longe demais.\r\nAh, eu abomino a \u00e1rea de sa\u00fade e policial. Particularmente prefiro ci\u00eancia jur\u00eddica. Chega de horror. N\u00e3o quero lucrar nada do horror, n\u00e3o sinto prazer na injusti\u00e7a. E coisa boa \u00e9 estudar, orar, fazer o bem, amar as pessoas, ser generosa, instruir o mundo e as pessoas para o bem. Coisa boa \u00e9 perdoar por\u00e9m jamais devemos aceitar o mal. A melhor coisa que fiz foi aceitar Jesus como Senhor e Salvador de minha vida. A outra melhor coisa que fiz foi fazer DIREITO. Certamente a faculdade de direito e passar na OAB foi algo encantador. Caso leias esse texto ir\u00e1s ver a verdade...De fato, \u00e9 melhor todos voltarmos para casa, voltarmos para Deus. A verdade \u00e9 que a vida n\u00e3o roubou nada mas \"roubaram\" momentos bons da vida que ela poderia ter passado com pessoas mais agrad\u00e1veis e que de fato se importassem com ela. \u00c9 melhor a dura verdade do que uma doce mentira. N\u00e3o quero viver uma mentira, pois a verdade \u00e9 o melhor caminho. Jesus disse em Jo\u00e3o 14:6: Eu sou o caminho, a verdade e a vida. Eu escolho Jesus, a verdade e os meus valores b\u00edblicos. A b\u00edblia diz em 2 Cor\u00edntios 13:8, pois nada podemos contra a verdade, sen\u00e3o em favor da verdade. Eu escolho sempre a liberdade e descobrir toda a verdade, pois sei que Jesus disse que era o caminho, a verdade e a vida. Eu escolho sempre minha fam\u00edlia verdadeira, ci\u00eancia jur\u00eddica, ci\u00eancia pol\u00edtica, sociologia, filosofia, cultura. \u00c9, precisamos voltar para casa, voltar para Deus.\r\nAssinado: Doce Fabi!",

I wish you had been around when I was playing \"Piano Man\" a million times. This song has made me start singing again. (retired many years ago) Even though my piano and PA is in a little room, I pumped it up to learn this, a song I JUST heard.  I forgot how MUCH I loved music. And how much I miss it. Thank you ...and the dance routine? Superb. Tell me, did YOU Have dance lessons at anytime in your life? Some of those lifts were not easy. It was nice to see a routine that actaully expressed the words and music. That's rare nowadays. \n\nI am now, one of your many million of fans.",

This song was a source of hope for me and my son. Before sleeping we would listen to this song in the hospital. Rameshwar recently died at 9 recently of cancer. Now every time I listen to this song I think of my son and how he would run up to me and start humming this song. The worst thing any parent can witness is seeing their child die before them.\nWhoever you are, wherever you are, stay with your family and enjoy every moment you spend with them because one day they will no longer be with you. Never underestimate the power of love. It can come like a thought and disappear into thin air in a snap.\nStay safe.\nThank You for the support. It means a lot.",
