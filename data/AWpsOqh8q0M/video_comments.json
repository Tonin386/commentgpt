        "text": "after 13 years of marriage, I found out my wife was cheating on me, with a guy who was also married himself. I never once came close to cheating our entire marriage. I worked a lot, and bought our house, and paid for just about everything. We have a son together. I appreciated everything she did, raising our child, cleaning the house, etc. But over time, all of that stuff stopped, after about 8 years or so. I started bringing my son to school everyday, and picking him up from my mother in laws house. She stopped cleaning, cooking, etc. Starting going out with friends from work, other mothers from our sons pre school, etc. She even stopped asking me \"how do I look?\" and didn't even tell me when she was gonna be back home. This went on for awhile. We would have talks sometimes and things would get better for a little while but eventually it would start back up again. \n\nIt really sucks because I loved her so much. I still remember the times when were first in love, and just talked and laughed about everything. I tried everything I could to keep the marriage going, thought I would grow old with her, but, once I found out she was sleeping with this other guy I knew it was over. I wasn't mad....more just really really upset and hurt. This was about 4 years ago now, she is still with that guy that she cheated on me with, (he ended up getting a divorce as well). They seem happy together, but they aren't married, and I am not sure if they ever plan on it. \n\nI ended up giving her and my son the house, and went and bought a new house right before covid hit. We share custody sort of, she has him full time mostly, I have my don Wednesdays and every other weekend. But now that he is getting older, he just stays home all week lately and I see him on the weekends, but I know real soon he is gonna want to start going out with his friends and stay close to home. That has obviously been the hardest thing about all of this. I don't feel like I lost my son, but man I sure did lose a lot of time with him over the years. I myself am not dating and not looking to probably ever get into another relationship, I am 38 now and well, I just don't see the point, I don't want to go through all of that again I don't think lol. This song is a tough one to get through, I feel like I am the beginning of the video when its her perspective, and it hurts so damn much.",

The easiest title in the entire world is *Woman* bc all you do is have shit handed to you, bought for you, whether by another man, woman, family or hell even the mfing government. Being a man we have to work for everything! Every. Thing. We rarely get mfrs holding doors open for us. And we def cannot go online and get validation by posting a picture when we're sad, lonely or feeling insecure about shit. Hell nah. F this song",

She held a grudge that he raised her hand, I do not approve of this in him, but she provoked him, she destroyed their relationship herself, and then she realized that he was moving away and she wanted herself to him ...",

Start a new life new man I know this persoanlly and see this alot \n\nGuy now has to start his life over again no most likely only getting to see his kids on the weekend or when he isnt working and having to hear stories of mums new man etc and one word or move and boom your not seeing the kids this weekend or again in many cases the children get used as weapons against us \n\nI could go on but nust a bit of the flip side here on this subject \n\nSome guys are d!cks but many women get good guys and treat them like crap \n\nWhich in turn leaves men thinking I dont want to suffer no more than I already have so maybe just a quick thing here and there is better \n\nBut oh wait all men want us for is one thing.. not always the case many of us want it all and more but they not many out there that are 100% do or die women left it seem at least here in the Uk its very slim pickings e.g. oh she look nice sounds nice few messge late oh i hope you dont minf but i do Only Fans or am seeing you but when am not  they is this other guy who i bang too but you aint going to know about that \n\nThe last part also applies to guys too as we ain't saints but also because we know the game alot of women out there play so why should we it could be seen or said",
