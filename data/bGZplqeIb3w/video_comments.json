The part where it shows Harry at the stage alone and the lyrics that says \"I can feel you are lonely\" makes me think that way. Both the lonely person that is waiting to be realized and healed, and the person who tries to reach and help are the same, it is Harry himself. At the end, satellite reaches Harry and its mission is completed because from now on its within Harry and there is no need for it anymore in the outside world. It is a story of becoming one with your inner self which needs help and also is able to cure.",

It was night time and I was just leaving the train station when I just happened to look up and I kid u not, saw a line of stars connected to each other that shot from one end of the sky to the other. I took a video of it and everything because it was just the coolest thing I had ever seen. I had no idea if it was a meteor or some debri but all i know is this song instantly popped in my head. These past few months have been the worst of my life and Ive been stuck in the coldest winter I've ever experienced. I haven't even seen a clear sky in ages, just dark clouds which has been the very essence of my depressed feelings. This one incredible phenomenon that only I happened to see late at night when no one else was around and the clouds happened to clear felt so special to me. And the fact that it made me think of this song - not to sound cheesey, but its like Harry's telling me its gonna be okay\u2764",

        "text": "Soooo I haven\u2019t listened to this album probably since last year, I think because it just reminds me of a lot of hard things that happened round this time then - my grandfather died, my friendships were falling apart, I was really overweight and unhealthy and obviously all of that causes a lot of anxiety and stress, but I was just sitting and thinking like, how can I just forget about how this music GOT ME THROUGH those things and jus not listen to it? it was a really comforting thing in a really scary and upsetting time for me and I mean that\u2019s always kind of how it was. I was following one direction from the early years when Harry had those adorable curls and Louie always had suspenders and all that, wayyy before it was \u201ccool\u201d to like one direction. I had all the cds, and posters and t shirts you name it heh e. And that was alllll I used to write about in school and I remember the teacher used to get so annoyed constantly hearing me talk about those \u201csinging British lads\ud83d\ude02\u201d. Seriously though, I had a lot of surgeries and anesthesia from a really young age, about 1 or 2 years old , I have a very rare genetic mutation and like don\u2019t have an actual eye color and my vision is pretty bad yea it\u2019s super weird. That being said I was pretty weird kid and o always sorta stuck out a bit like a round peg in a square hole. I didn\u2019t really have many friends, but I had my music and I was made up with that Like I said earlier even though it\u2019s a lot to think about sometimes when I realize just how much music always meant to me it\u2019s just\u2026crazy. It\u2019s so powerful in that a song can make you cry or dance or laugh or just sit there and listen and awe and this song really does that for me man\u2026 ahhh god I love him so much. Always was a Harry girlie, still am\u2764",
