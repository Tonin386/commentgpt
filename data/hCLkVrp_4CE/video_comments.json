She had no security guards around which I thought was really weird.\nAnd as I watched her dance my intrusive thoughts just went, 'this is an insanely rich and famous person. She's just a few feet away from me. I could kill her right now and become famous myself. I'd get arrested but I'd be famous.' \nBut I beat the intrusive thoughts and I'm really glad I did because this is a banger!",

An here is scientific proof of God.HARVARD UNIVERSITY found evidence of God in our DNA \ud83e\uddec and it saids, \"Yahweh is the 1 true God. An to tell the world peacefully.\" An that's what im doing to this day! Lol\n\nAn btw, im single and want A fairy tale love with A princess, like A man of God like me deserves. I'm over Dua Lipa and her prideful ways. I had A crush on her lately for some reason and I realize all of them celebrities, people worship, are all horrible murderous criminals, that, are worshipping satan himself! Seriously. They are in A underground gang called the free masons(Illuminati) an the celebs have to go threw rights of passage and do rituals and sex rituals, eating or drinking blood of humans sacrifice! An they do horribly unspeakable things and then they use their money and power, givin from satan, to promote Satan's wicked Agendas to push darkness into the youth's minds. They all badly need to be delt with! We must band together! There is no time to waste! Murderers go free time! That can't keep going on while we just go excuses for not taking A stand against Satan and his gang/army. We all might lose our souls too if we let them influence us to badly. It's already super hard to not let the Hollywood industry indoctrinate us. Or school doing it! They actually put pseudoscience Opinion based facts in with real truths. So that's how they LEGALLY indoctrinated the Masses, like us and our children man! We gotta think of our family and our own souls being at stake over these liars and manipulators deceiving and indoctrinating the masses with the theory of Evolution.",

        "text": "Thoughts Attack Me \n \n[Intro] \nAh! Yeah! Come on! Aha! Yea! Buss it! Buss it! \nYou know\u2026 I love b\u2026tching \nWhen I feel sad. Rich and \nEvil dudes try to diminish me. \nThey can\u2019t finish me. Snitching \nFails. Justice prevails \nWhen my gun stops glitching. \nI love b\u2026tching \nWhen sorrow irritates me. \nI go crazy. Hell awaits thee. \nFires are ama-ama-amazing. \nEnemies burn in my crematorium. \nIt\u2019s a sad story and I get dic-dic-dictatorial. \nRevenge creeps under my corium. \nI speak Vic-vic-victorian when I pull the trigger. \nMy shadow gets big-big-bigger in my crematorium-orium-orium\u2026 \n \n[Verse 1] \nThoughts attack me exactly when demons try to whack me. \nRelatives don\u2019t back me because they envy me. Frankly, \nI hate \u2018em too. F\u2026ck my shaky roots! They won\u2019t make it. Boots \nFall on \u2018em. Laudanum is all they drink to think like a murderer. \nI order-order rum to drown my sorrow. Run away from \nThe horror. Fun is a rare guest. I do my best to earn a dollar. Slum \nIs my home town. When I wanna glow crowds \nLaugh and get slow. Chow is cold now. Hungry like a mole. Out \nFor weeks. Gnats bite my cheeks. I feel bad like creeps. \nDragons fly. Deeds pile up like beats. Cops die on streets. \nBut I don\u2019t care. I wanna grow. Lairs make me vomit like a crow. Dare \nSpeak the truth after chic booze. I live under snow. Mares \nI feed on help me grow. Bear a grudge against the dope mayor. \nI know-know the truth is out there. \n \n[Chorus] \nThoughts in my head. Thoughts in my head. \nDemons gonna jump-jump. \nMemory\u2019s dead. Memory\u2019s dead. \nSparrows drinking blood-blood. \n \n[Verse 2] \nTalking to the mirror. I ain\u2019t a hero. They call me Loser, man! \nThat\u2019s why I get woozy. Pen is my sword I like to use again. \nA pussy\u2019s phlegm makes me sick. That\u2019s a crazy flick. \nP\u2026rn is amazing sh\u2026t. When I get lazy, a hit \nDispels my wistfulness. I miss-miss fool pests. \nI never eat to the full. Jest to revive my mood. Yes. \nI burn a fool\u2019s nest when I steal some cool eggs. \nIf Hunger whispers, I do whatever it wants. Woo \nPretty b\u2026tches to get richer like Wu. \nPlay and mix blues when chicks snooze. \nI give \u2018em bricks. Lose myself in Eminem\u2019s music. \nI crave for a happy end. My bang crew\u2019s sick \nLike bachelor John Cusack. F\u2026ck the society! \nGonna be a star. Firing bazookas. Lucas inspires me \nTo write stories fuelled by anxiety when bastards dehire me. \nI get high and dream of islands. Shooting vipers \nIs fun. Spooky spiders, go home! Leave me alone. \nGonna make my groupie ride me. \n \n[Chorus] \nThoughts in my head. Thoughts in my head. \nDemons gonna jump-jump. \nMemory\u2019s dead. Memory\u2019s dead. \nSparrows drinking blood-blood. \n \n[Verse 3] \nMy life is an endless alphabet. Idiots keep laughing at \nMy f\u2026ck-ups. Madhouse understaffing and \nEmptiness cause my laughter. At\u2026 large \nLike Burrows. My arrows keep attacking rats \nWho live in the jungle shacks. They die of hunger. Gnats \nBite \u2018em too. My crew can juggle bats. \nDinosaurs in the tunnel. Max goes mad \nBecause of getting fungal. Axe after axe. \nTheir heads bangle. Cats chase Bob\u2019s uncles. Vats \nFull of sharks and brats. Enjoy the jungle, lads! \nSwords punish foes. Ghosts vanish. Gross. \nI ain\u2019t uppish. Show ain\u2019t over. I\u2019m a soldier. \nGonna break your nose. Sorry for my sad story. Gore \nOn my hands. Blast lorries. Law is toilet paper. \nHatred\u2019s victims galore. War after war. \nVirtual reality bothers me. You don\u2019t cure mentality. \nSo I dally-dally. D wanna placate me. They hate me. \nBrutality is a loco\u2019s path. Tread on the broken glass. \nK\u2026ll bogans. Dust and locals\u2019 ash make me laugh \nLike Joker Slash. \n \n[Chorus] \nThoughts in my head. Thoughts in my head. \nDemons gonna jump-jump. \nMemory\u2019s dead. Memory\u2019s dead. \nSparrows drinking blood-blood. \n \n[Outro] Policeman: \nGood evening, mam! We\u2019ve found a guy who claims to be a founder. Why \nDid you release \u2018im? His reason is sick. He offered me a brick. \nParamedics fixed his fried chick. \nPsychiatrists will help your son recover. \nHe says that he is undercover. \nHe chases demons who killed his lover. \nIs Rihanna your son\u2019s wife? \nIs he playing with a big knife? \nMam, I think your son is tripping. He should be sipping \nSome syrup in a madhouse. \nNo. There is neither a mouse nor a louse. Mam, your son will forget such bouts. \nPlease don\u2019t worry! He will be treated in the best madhouse-house-house. \n \n\u00a9 Norfum 2023. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",

I have been a Barbie fan since I was a child and for me she was a family doll. You distorted the history of Barbie. I expected a Barbie story that was more fantasy, adventure or romantic. I think Greta Gerwig should not have directed the movie because she distorted everything.",
