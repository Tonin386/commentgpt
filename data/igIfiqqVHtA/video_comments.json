Hi,  I hope this letter finds you.  \n First of all, thank you for making me feel loved,  cared for, and happy for a span of what three weeks HAHAHAHAH.  You are the most consistent, brilliant,  caring guy I have talked to. You learned some words in my dialect,  you watched Zoey's extraordinary playlist that I recommended, you never skipped a day reminding me to take my medicine, we talked about our traumas, and you understood me.  We had a lot in common: the love for Taylor Swift,  the love for Hamilton, and our traumas. HAHAHHAHA. I will never forget you and how I woke up with my alarm clock helpless and then heard you singing, satisfied- that will be one of my top 5 most amazing things that happened to me. I was enchanted to meet you, but please be in love with someone who will love you the way I could never.  Be in love with someone who will give you assurance and will risk for you because, trust me, you are worth the risk,  but I am not courageous enough. I'm sorry for being scared; I'm sorry for giving up too quickly, and I'm sorry for hurting you.  I hope that you will believe in love because you deserve the love the world has to offer. I hope we can meet again,  and if we ever meet again, I hope you reach your dream of being a doctor.  PADAYON FUTURE DOCTOR! I will always be here cheering for you!",

It didnt lead to anything after that. If I'm not wrong  they never really confessed to each other about their feelings . However the fact that she wrote this song about him and him also revealing later to the media that he also was crushing on her AND him making a cover of enchanted shows that somewhere sometime there were sparks flying ..and really strong sparks..but idk why they didnt take this friendship up to the next level.Their story is like that girl/guy ypu see on the street who you are really drawn to but you know woull never be with them and it tugs on your heart",

Deep inside, I felt that he liked me too. Lagi ko siyang nahuhuling nakatingin sa'kin. Buong HS, hindi ko ipinakita sa kanya na gusto ko siya (not in front of him). If he was (near) around at tinutukso ako, I always say \"Hindi ah. Bakit sana (gusto ko siya)\". But the whole class knew na super crush ko siya. Even his bff who's fortunately my great dear friend too. I made sure to always attend to his basketball match, cheering for him from afar. Back in 2012 (my birthday), kinukulit nila siya at tinatanong kung sino yung may birthday sa araw na yun. He spelled every letter of my name out loud, \"Si I - S - L  - E\". Then our classmates teased and laughed at us. \n\nGraduation came, I was crying too hard. I didn't have the chance to confess my feelings for him - even if his BFF told me to do it even if it's too late. Wala akong lakas, wala pa.",
