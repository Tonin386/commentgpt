Its so good and so perfect to the point that people aren't used to this technical ability and sharp skill nowadays and its sad cause i even thought it was trash but nah this is what a real elite rapper sounds like and it's honestly superb. I fuck with this verse heavy now.",

At some point though...you have to try to make good music otherwise you destroy your image.\nThis 'song' is just weak ...that is just my opinion.\nI realise given the comments here...this will go against all the fans...but shouldn't music actually make sense or have a message of some type??? This has nothing.\nI will say Freedom was a very good track...just not this one.",
