Stadiums will cancel names that do so. All the things you encountered as a file. The cinematic concert I thinks still is the future of music sold at concessions with prefab 3dimax concerts to 2d and screen X which shows right and left walls a screen view like what in front. I don't know better off with all on cinematic concerts. Could do free music CD with minimum price tickets. Regal unlimited has movies that still cost more even in 2d. So cinematic concert minimums could be 12 but get CD. Then offer concession items. Stadiums most are old and need to be turned into dairy factories. Lol. Sports over bikinis. I'm a dude thank you I watch women's beach volleyball",

Jp people / anyone that knows Japanese as a language laugh at the tattoo and it became kind of a meme for a while when this song got popular. Tldr be careful when you decide to get a tattoo of Chinese/Japanese characters on your body because chances are that you'll just end up looking like an idiot",

Narcotics Officer, Semjase is interested in trying to take James Moore from Twitter to a prison colony planet and there is no way that he'll be taken alive, and he really defeated me, I will say, and maybe all the other ones that have passed away cannot speak because the UFO experience proved to be too much for them, that's why the suicide happened within FIGU and it's bullshit, Ariana Grande is trying to help the situation, though, she's definitely been making strides in a healthy direction!",

SHE MATCHED IT PERFECTLY WITH THE SONG!! props to queen. and the whole pink barbie-style aesthetic was really fun and worked perfect. SO YES ARIANA VERY ICONIC",

        "text": "Ariana Grande\u2019s 6 albums if they were human siblings: \n\nPositions (2020):\n~ AGE: 20\n~RELATION: The oldest sister\n~ PERSONALITY: The most responsible and mature sibling of them all who takes care of all her younger siblings and is the one in charge. Feeds them, disciplines them and takes charge all day every day. \n~ CLOSEST TO? All 5 of her younger siblings \n\nThank U, Next (2019) \n~ AGE: 19\n~RELATION: 2nd oldest sister \n~PERSONALITY: The most outgoing sibling who spends every late night out with her friends partying and drinking during the night. During the day, she\u2019s the most introverted sibling who\u2019s to herself and is always there for who ever needs advice regarding relationships. \n~ CLOSEST TO? Sweetener \n\nSweetener (2018)\n~AGE: 18\n~RELATION: 3rd oldest sister \n~PERSONALITY : The most chill sibling of them all and tends to be the sweetest as well. She always obeys her older sisters and is very respectful towards her younger siblings as well. She spoils her younger siblings and spends as much as quality time with her older sisters. Whenever someone is sad, she\u2019s always there to sing a sweet lullaby to cheer them up.\n~CLOSEST TO? Positions \n\nDangerous Woman (2016)\n~AGE: 16\n~RELATION: 4th oldest sister \n~PERSONALITY: The most rebellious of them all who thinks she can do whatever she wants just because she just turned 16. She never gets along with any of her siblings and always breaks the rules. She even sneaks out when no one is watching and meets up with boys who she knows from school and does some crazy stuff.\n~CLOSEST TO? None \n\nMy Everything (2014)\n~AGE: 14\n~RELATION: 5th oldest sister \n~PERSONALITY: The most conceited and sassy sibling who loves to pick on her younger sibling. She thinks she\u2019s better than most of her siblings and acts like a princess. She doesn\u2019t have time for no one\u2019s crap and only gets along with boys she has a crush on. \n~CLOSEST TO? Yours Truly \n\nYours Truly (2013)\n~AGE: 13\n~RELATION: The youngest sister\n~PERSONALITY: the youngest sibling of them all who\u2019s the most nicest and innocent sibling compared to all of her older sisters. She loves all her siblings equally and is The Sweet Angel that everyone loves (except for \u2018My everything\u2019). She never gets in trouble for anything and always listens to her oldest sister whenever she\u2019s told to do something.\n~ CLOSEST TO? My Everything",
