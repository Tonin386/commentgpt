Growing up I was always told by my dads Family to stay out of the sun and not to get darker then what I already am because it won\u2019t look good on me. I was told that I would stain my skin. Fast forward I\u2019ve had my own little Queens \ud83d\udc51 who have a darker skin tone than Me and I have learned to appreciate more and more and as for my family that used to tell me those things, they\u2019ve all been cut out of our lives. Now I\u2019m learning to teach my Queens to love themselves no matter what they look like.",

Beyonce considers Kelly every bit her true sister as much as Solange. The two of them have been through so much together from childhood, success/fame, navigating the entertainment industry, motherhood, and so much more. Kelly is one of Bey's ride or dies and Bey will never forget that. Also, the song and video may also be Bey's way of addressing colorism and the longtime narrative that Kelly's darker complexion held her solo career back while Bey's lighter complexion helped to fuel hers. This was Bey's public way of telling Kelly she's enough and she's beautiful the way she is.",

Henson, Amy Schumer, Sheryl Lee Ralph then I felt pretty and confidence. After listening to their speech, movies and songs I gained confidence. Right now I feel that I'm beautiful \ud83d\ude0d\u2763\ufe0f. Everyone is beautiful. Nobody is ugly or unattractive we are all living in a judgemental society which is a curse for our lives and also created by unrealistic beauty standards. I can't understand if people can say that Angelina, Bella they are extraordinary beautiful why can't they say that - Julia Pastrana, Serena Williams, Whoopi Goldberg, Halle Berry, Jennifer Hudson, Mindy Kailing, Venus Williams, Sarah Jessica, Lizzie, Gaboury Sidibe, Lizzo, Taraji. P. Henson, Viola Davis, Kerry Washington they are also extraordinarily beautiful \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc90??? Black, Brown, White we are all beautiful. Not only sharp nose, tall height, big eyes, thin lips, Skiny body is beautiful but also Wide nose, short height, small eyes, fat lips, curvey body is beautiful. Therefore, we are all beautiful\ud83c\udf39. \n#weareallbeautiful.\n#beconfident \u2764.",

        "text": "Beyonce is the best female artist nowadays. Her vocals are beyond perfection and i love so much that her late album is more African, it shows her roots and her power.  \nAfrican woman suffered so much  . The traditions of their own countries, the brutality of men, slavery in USA, segregation, the lack of    possibilities to work and be what they wanted to be. Only now the situation is changing. They could become a political figure, a well paid artist, a doctor. And the worst thing is that our DNA is almost similar, white and brown skin is only colour, but people suffered so much though history because of prejudice. It makes me so sad. The colour purple ( film) as an example of that sad and cruel life of brown women. So glad that it came to an end.",

The West has its own reasons but in india the only point is being a perfect marriage candidate because they want a model-like girl as a bride but not with those clothes\ud83d\ude05. But as i am lighter shade now, they think i am a somewhat perfect candidate.\nSomeone like me who loves indian culture deeply. I really want this colonial colourism to go away.

I was called white girl by many growing up and always wanted darker skin as a child (not anymore, I love my complexion now). I have a lot of aunts and uncles and most of my aunts are dark, I have one that's a little lighter than the rest but I have always seen just as much beauty in a darker woman as in any other woman. What bothers me is when I am with someone (black people) and they will make a comment about how dark and ugly someone is and I will literally look at the same person they are referring to and see absolute beauty. It saddens me so bad what darker women go through within our community and otherwise. I pray every brown skin woman in this planet gets the chance to hear this song \ud83d\ude4f You are ALL gorgeous and don't let ANYONE tell you different.",

This is so wild. Makes no sense and feels like utter madness.\nThere are so many skin colors in the world, and that's amazing. They're so varied, and that's beautiful. From Nordic pale to dark African night, each shade has its own unique beauty, and tells its owner's story, and the story of their people. Why on earth would anyone deny any skin color the pride and the right to shine? I can't understand that. Crazy. Just crazy.",
