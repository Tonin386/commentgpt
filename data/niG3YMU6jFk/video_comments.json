I can certainly picture a few other famous male and female singers from other bands playing other musical instruments & singing backup vocals on this song with her. Imagine Don Henley of the eagles band doing background vocals on it along with drums or percussion like I\u2019ve seen him do in the eagles during their live concerts. No clue who else in the music biz I would pick to help out Adele on this wonderful song. Great music video here too.",

Not hard to understand from watching the video and listening to the lyrics. Music is good and Adele is a phenomenal singer. I'm disappointed though in the messaging bc she says even though she knows it's bad or wrong she's going to do it anyway. Idk there is this \"dirty\" & dark feeling watching the video,  but you can't deny this woman's talent.",
