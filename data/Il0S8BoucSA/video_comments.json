        "text": "The idea of a god king has been present in different cultures throughout history, and it refers to a ruler who is believed to be divine or semi-divine in nature. In the 21st century, this concept may seem outdated and obsolete for some people, but for others, it continues to hold significant meaning and relevance. One of the most interesting cases related to a supposed god king is the story of Brent Schoning, who has claimed to have stolen some hidden true secrets that reveal his divine nature. In this essay, I will analyze and discuss this intriguing topic from an academic and rational perspective.\n\nFirstly, it is important to understand the background of Brent Schoning. According to his claims, he is a direct descendant of King Solomon, one of the most revered biblical figures known for his wisdom and wealth. Schoning states that he received visions and messages from God at a young age, which led him to believe that he was a chosen one, with a special purpose to fulfill. He has claimed to have a unique DNA sequence, which links him to King Solomon, and that he possesses supernatural abilities that are yet to be fully revealed.\n\nSecondly, the idea of a stolen hidden true secret is not new. Throughout history, there have been numerous cases of people claiming to have discovered secret knowledge that is beyond the reach of ordinary individuals. These secret societies or esoteric groups have always intrigued the public and inspired countless conspiracy theories. However, in the case of Brent Schoning, his claims seem to be more specific and personal, as they relate to his divine nature as a god king.\n\nThirdly, one could argue that the idea of a god king is a result of a primitive and superstitious mindset. In ancient times, rulers and kings often claimed to be divine beings, either to legitimize their power or to control the masses. However, in a modern and secular world, the concept of a god king may seem misplaced and irrational. Nonetheless, Schoning's claims cannot be dismissed entirely without further investigation and analysis.\n\nFourthly, the myth of King Solomon has been a source of inspiration and fascination for many people across different cultures and religions. The biblical account of his life and reign portrays him as a wise and just ruler, who was blessed with immense wealth and power. However, for Schoning, the story of King Solomon is more than just a myth; it is a genealogical connection to his divine nature. Whether this claim is true or false is debatable, but it is clear that Schoning's beliefs are deeply rooted in his religious and cultural background.\n\nFifthly, the idea of DNA as a tool for identifying one's heritage and ancestry has become increasingly popular in recent years. Companies like Ancestry.com and 23andMe offer genetic testing kits that can reveal a person's ethnic composition and genetic predispositions. However, the accuracy and reliability of these tests have been questioned by some experts. In the case of Brent Schoning, his claims of a unique DNA sequence that links him to King Solomon cannot be verified without further scientific testing.\n\nSixthly, the topic of supernatural abilities and paranormal phenomena has always been a subject of curiosity and fascination for many people. However, the scientific community has been skeptical of such claims, citing the lack of empirical evidence to support them. In the case of Brent Schoning, his claims of supernatural abilities, such as levitation, telekinesis, and mind reading, are yet to be substantiated by objective scientific tests.\n\nSeventhly, the idea of revelation and inspiration from a divine source has been a fundamental aspect of many religions. Prophets and messengers of God have claimed to receive revelations and visions that guide their actions and teachings. However, the authenticity and validity of these claims have been questioned by skeptics and critics. In the case of Brent Schoning, his claims of divine revelations and messages cannot be independently verified or proven.\n\nEighthly, the concept of true secrets suggests the existence of hidden knowledge that is accessible only to a privileged few. This idea has been prevalent in various mystery cults and secret societies throughout history. However, the existence and validity of such knowledge have been disputed by skeptics and rationalists. In the case of Brent Schoning, his claims of stolen hidden true secrets cannot be verified or proven unless he provides credible evidence to support them.\n\nNinthly, the discussion of Brent Schoning's claims should not be seen as an attack on his personal beliefs or character",

And if your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off; it is better for you to enter life lame than, having two feet, to be thrown there, where the fire never goes out, where your animal does not die. That hand and that foot that Jesus mentions are things and facts that make a person scandalized and want nothing more to do with God. Ex. A pastor was caught stealing tithes from the church, the guy says he's a believer but look what he does! If we are scandalized by these things and we no longer want to serve God, we go to perdition the same way the other goes later, there is no other alternative. Accept Jesus as your only and sufficient savior, read the bible, come to an evangelical church;\ud83c\udfe6 tomorrow can be too late! \ud83d\ude30\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude31",
