Meg is a rapper, I would love to hear here rap more. \n\nI think women in rap can do more than what they're doing lyrically and with their songwriting. Being a woman comes with complexities and it's rare to hear mainstream artist address any of it outside of sexuality. \n\nI refuse to believe that's the main topic a female rapper can present. Especially when it's done in the same format repeatedly. Cardi debut album was amazing and some of the songs she's dropped since have been cool but I would probably rank this one at the bottom.\n\nStill love hearing her verse on Tomorrow 2 and I love that Cardi.",

I listened out of curiosity and not tryna hate but anyone else think this song is...mediocre? Sure the visuals are great but these aren't bars, just punchlines intended to deliver some shock value (i.e. p*ssy tight like a nun) and sound bites for viral social media clips. This song feels like someone in the music industry said if we recreate wap on a club beat, it'll top the charts and be an easy cash grab. If you like it, cool thats dope. I just personally hope I never have to hear it again loool",
