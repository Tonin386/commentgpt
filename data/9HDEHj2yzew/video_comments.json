Kylie should be a bigger star than M globally because hands down Kylie is not of this world.\nMadonna just knows what buttons we need pushed and then rips them out and shoves it back in because she knows that what we need but with M the past several year it seems force contrived and desperate to stay Queen.

Who was friendly, who helped, who waited, who was bitter who was sick.\nThe heart endures, cries and loves Peacefully gnawing and loving all the same remembers what it used to be, the star was shining, children were jumping and having fun The soul rejoiced and endured.\nAnxiety, pain, all possible was, and you loved and hearts stuttered in tears where there were many s'mores, adventure, the freedom of many ages and the peace of heart will return. And love will turn into a fairy tale of happiness and the right path of the soul, colorful times of two worlds. With heartfelt strength and pain and you will understand, love is always with you and near who is with you love and bring a sea of happiness.  God will give you strength, faith, and all that you have asked for, and God will love you. The main thing is to do good, and give your heart to warm all with emotion. And faith, the power of life, it's all in the soul, you'll understand everything, and God loves you always!",

        "text": "I can't help but conclude that aside from the obvious themes of lust and mocking the afterlife \"I don't want to live another life\" this is blasphemous against Islam. She comes from an Islamic upbringing and background and most certainly understands the significance of dressing in all black and having people run around her counter clockwise in a circle. It seems to be a mocking of the circling of the Kaaba during Hajj.\n\nThere is always an esoteric hidden occupy meaning.\n\nHer lust takes her to the edge of a seemingly bottomless pit that she could fall into, but she proclaims it is a simulation and then the camera angle changes and reveals the pit is an illusion and she is not in danger of being cast into any pit for her lust. In short, it is a proclamation that there is no hell and no penalty for lust or fornication.\n\nThe entire video and song are basically her covertly renouncing her faith and proclaiming there is no hell, prior to her having her physical followers run a circle around her while she is dressed in black on an elevated platform in a mocking ritual of Hajj, as she proclaims it is all physical. She is set up as an idol on a false altar of sex and orgasm.\n\nWhoever did this video and song has a deep knowledge of the occult and psychological methods of influence with the lyrics and the way the video dance routine was done.",
