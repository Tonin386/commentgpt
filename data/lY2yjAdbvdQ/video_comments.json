I met a man who was very much like the man described in this song about 9 months before my wedding, 92/93 I have never forgotten about him, even after all these years. He is the one that got away. If you find a someone who is truly that way about you, and you feel the same way about them...especially if you are being pressed by family to do something different..go for it! Don't let yourself ask what if  when you're old like me \ud83d\udcaf chase your heart and see where you land \u2764 No matter what don't let others make you feel obligated to do something that no longer feels right!",
