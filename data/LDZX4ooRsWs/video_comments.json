Und ich h\u00f6r es TAG f\u00fcr TAG und das MEHRFACH.\nDas ist ein verdammtes Meisterwerk und von daher echt RESPEKT f\u00fcr so eine Leistung.\nVorallem ist da auch so ein Herz und Gef\u00fchl dabei und ist nicht einfach so ein hingerotzter Song wie bei 99% der anderen Rapper.\nDas ist wirklich ein Lied der Kategorie \"Selbst meine Hater h\u00f6ren den Song rauf und runter\".",

I am a porn addict, this video ruined my mental state and half my life. I discovered porn when I was 9 and this video inadvertently led me down this disgusting destructive rabbit hole, to any who thinks I am not being serious, I am. I have genetics that have a history of getting addicted to things easily and so at the young age of 7 I accidently discovered this video while looking up the Amazonian anaconda. and like an anaconda, the addiction squeezed the life out of me. I had a nightmare last night of undulating masses of flesh joined together in a joyous orgy. I felt like throwing up. Sometimes I fantasized about cutting off that organ and being done with it I can't do this anymore. I'm leaving  this comment here as a way of finally being able to face that demon. It's all my fault. I don't want my mother to be disappointed in me anymore, I don't my father mistrustful of me. I hate myself for the things I have seen and the things I shouldn't have looked up.  from now on, I want to become a better person. I'm sorry to my family. I'm sorry... I feel like some of my actions are irredeemable but if people change for the better I can forgive myself.",
