(Los Funcionarios y Maestros deben leer y releer el plan de ense\u00f1anza y los lineamientos y pol\u00edticas del Gobierno para recordar los lineamientos, pol\u00edticas y lineamientos del Gobierno).\n\nEspero que la Uni\u00f3n de J\u00f3venes, los funcionarios locales y la escuela, el personal del puesto de salud de la comuna trabajen juntos regularmente para ir a la escuela a difundir conocimientos m\u00e1s \u00fatiles y equipar a los estudiantes con habilidades para la vida, los estudiantes tengan conocimientos sobre la prevenci\u00f3n de ahogamiento y la prevenci\u00f3n de drogas. de los males sociales, propaganda sobre la ley sobre el orden y la seguridad del tr\u00e1fico, propaganda para mantener a los estudiantes alejados del juego de los desmayos en l\u00ednea, propaganda para que los estudiantes ya no peleen, no a la violencia escolar, independientemente de la regi\u00f3n, propaganda para que los estudiantes digan no al racismo y discriminaci\u00f3n de color, promover que los estudiantes vivan la igualdad de g\u00e9nero, prestar m\u00e1s atenci\u00f3n a la educaci\u00f3n sexual y al sexo seguro para los estudiantes (cada a\u00f1o en Vietnam hay m\u00e1s de 300 mil casos de aborto en edad escolar \"un n\u00famero muy alto y muy peligroso para los estudiantes . estudiantes\" (muchos profesores tienen miedo de los estudiantes y no se atreven a equiparlos con conocimientos sobre sexo seguro, por lo que todav\u00eda falta mucho conocimiento sobre la seguridad sexual de los estudiantes, por lo que los profesores no tienen miedo, pero tratan de superar la barrera del miedo por la salud y seguridad de nuestros queridos estudiantes). En la Escuela se debe propagar un d\u00eda al mes, la educaci\u00f3n es sustantiva y profunda. 20 d\u00edas deben propagarse a los miembros de la Uni\u00f3n Juvenil en la sede del Comit\u00e9 Comunal 1 d\u00eda. La gente deber\u00eda aportar ideas con valent\u00eda al Oficial. S\u00f3lo temo que los estudiantes carezcan de conocimientos \u00fatiles y habilidades para la vida, no demasiado.\n\nDurante las vacaciones de verano y cuando no est\u00e1n en la escuela, los estudiantes tienen mucho tiempo en casa para pasar el rato con amigos, por lo que los padres deben dotar a sus hijos de conocimientos \u00fatiles y habilidades para la vida todos los d\u00edas y recordarles que cuando salgan con amigos, no se inviten entre s\u00ed. pelear, no discriminar por motivos de raza y color, no se les permite usar drogas, no se les permite fumar marihuana, no se les permite fumar ketamina, no se les permite fumar pelota de risa, no fumar marihuana americana, no jugar juegos de p\u00f3quer en l\u00ednea, no jugar apuestas de f\u00fatbol, \u200b\u200bno confiar en grupos para n\u00fameros de loter\u00eda en l\u00ednea, no jugar a la loter\u00eda, no jugar al p\u00f3quer en l\u00ednea, no est\u00e1 permitido jugar apuestas de f\u00fatbol (jugar a la loter\u00eda es jugar al p\u00f3quer en l\u00ednea, jugar apuestas de f\u00fatbol es beber alcohol para refrescarse). no se inviten a nadar en el mar, no vayan a nadar al r\u00edo sin que un adulto los acompa\u00f1e. Los padres deben decirles a sus hijos cuando van a la escuela que escuchen al maestro, que no sean rebeldes, si la rebeld\u00eda es castigada por el maestro, no deben rega\u00f1ar al maestro. Los estudiantes que tienen 14 o 15 a\u00f1os van a llegar a la pubertad, por lo que los padres deben recordarles que si sienten algo por ni\u00f1os y ni\u00f1as, deben saber controlarse y si cruzan el l\u00edmite, usar cond\u00f3n o tomar pastillas anticonceptivas. Despu\u00e9s del sexo \" cada a\u00f1o en Vietnam hay m\u00e1s de 300.000 casos de aborto cerebral en edad escolar \" un n\u00famero muy alto y muy peligroso para los estudiantes \"\n\nLos padres tambi\u00e9n tienen que formarse y ser estrictos consigo mismos para que ellos mismos no se involucren en los males sociales para poder educar a sus hijos para que sus hijos no se involucren en los males sociales.\n\nPadres de familia, cuando vayan a una reuni\u00f3n de padres o a una reuni\u00f3n en el barrio, por favor aporten con valent\u00eda ideas a la Escuela y a los Funcionarios de la Villa o Comuna, no esperen hasta que el agua llegue a sus pies para saltar \"los males sociales en el pa\u00eds est\u00e1n aumentando \"La contribuci\u00f3n audaz de los padres est\u00e1 salvando las vidas de los estudiantes, los estudiantes y el futuro de la tierra.

Por lo tanto, cuando el personal y la Escuela y la Juventud Los miembros del sindicato regularmente brindan a los estudiantes conocimientos \u00fatiles y habilidades para la vida, los padres deben apreciar el afecto y la dedicaci\u00f3n del personal.
