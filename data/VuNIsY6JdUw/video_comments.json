YOU know that I am not going to hurt You.. but just to take Your Heart.. I want to hold YOU.. will you let me Hold YOU.. how about your Hands.. can I touch your Hands.. Can I hear YOU SPEAK.. I want to hear your words.. Please.. Open this Door.. Let me come.. so that I can come close to YOU.. YOU know that I have been waiting.. Waiting for YOU to show.. waiting For you.. I saw your Heart crying.. But as YOU enter the Room.. Your Heart.. LOOK.. she is smiling.. SO much like YOU.. SO Beautiful as YOU.. SO SO BEAUTIFUL.. SO PRETTY PRETTY.. YOU are the World most Beautiful.. Please Open this Door.. I want to touch That Heart.. Hold Your Heart.. and draw close to YOU.. so that YOU can feel my Heart.. My Heart has been waiting for this very day.. I just want to say to YOU.. I love YOU.. I love you so much.. will you let me say these words to YOU.. that I love you.. as I am waiting.. I see YOU look Down.. And YOU hold Your Heart.. both arms wrapped around Your Heart.. I see your Heart Smiling.. Giggling.. and I see YOU SMILE.. why can't I be smiling like that.. Only if YOU can trust Me.. trust me enough to Open this Door.. and Let me come close to YOU.. I know my mouth will fall to the ground because of SMILING TOO HARD.. just because it is YOU.. I can't open the door.. WILL you let me inside with YOU.. I want to be close so that I can touch your Heart.. I want to feel HOW YOUR HEART feel.. I want to hold Your Heart gently.. the way YOU are able to Hold your Heart.. can I hold YOUR HEART.. I will not hurt Your Heart.. but tell YOUR Heart.. for a long time.. I have been waiting.. waiting until I get Close.. until this day to Tell YOU.. I missed YOU.. I missed you because I am always thinking about YOU.. wondering and pondering.. Imagining that do we belong together.. are we suppose to Be.. are you the One for ME.. YOU are the one WHO I been longing for.. I be asking and asking.. I be howling in the dark.. I be appearing before the Moon.. when the Night has come.. I would show UP.. I know that the Moon be saying.. HE thinks I am a genie.. why is this person keep on appearing before Me.. and what am I suppose to do.. or even say to this person.. He is asking for something I just can't do.. I would look UP at the sky.. the Same Moon.. WILL you send me a Message.. I have the Picture.. I placed it into this empty Bottle.. I wrote a Letter.. WILL you send someone down here.. and take this Bottle.. Message in the Bottle for Me.. and I would stand there.. LOOKING at this MOON.. holding in my hand.. holding it UP.. I want to give it to YOU.. and I would wait.. and I would wait for an answer.. But there is NO Messenger coming through the Night as I would wait.. the next Night.. the third Night.. the fourth Night.. as I would stand there.. I feel my tears running down.. two lines as I am thinking about the Night and I would stand.. looking through the Glass wall.. Just wanting to be with YOU.. But.. I am looking at You Finally.. Nights I would turn away.. Looking down walking away from the Moon with the Message in the Bottle unable to give it to You.. My Heart be breaking.. How am I suppose to Give you this Letter.. I am now.. smiling.. Holding in my Hand is the Same Bottle.. inside it has Your Picture.. It has a Letter I have written.. with the Other hand I am wiping my tears.. For the longest Time.. do YOU not know how far I had come.. DO you not know that I love YOU this much.. I was told you Lived Miles and miles and miles away.. so Holding the Message in the Bottle.. I had to cross over few mountains.. it was such a Hard journey.. I would slip off.. rolling down.. But.. I got it.. I have me the Same Message inside this Bottle.. someone finally told me.. why am I standing there.. Looking at the Same Moon.. Night after Night.. I see you holding a Bottle.. I felt sorry for YOU so I had to come to ask.. and the person told me the way.. I am now standing here.. I want YOU to know that I been waiting for this day to Come.. YOU may not know it.. But I love YOU this Much to Come.. Can YOU Please Open this door for me.. I have YOUR LETTER inside this Bottle.. and I have wrote my Heart.. I wanted to give it to YOU.. before the Long journey back.. But.. can I first touch your Heart.. LOOK at that Heart.. Your Heart is so beautiful.. I want to hold Your Heart the way YOU are holding Her.. can I hold Your Heart.. She is like a Baby.. I want to hold Your Little Girl.. I want to hold Your Heart.. She is smiling and giggling.. I want it.. Can I have That Heart.. Your Heart.. please.. Let me touch your Heart.. Let me Hold Your Heart so that I can hold YOU and tell YOU.. How much I love YOU.. and Never stopped loving YOU.. always thinking about YOU.. just give me a Chance.. a Chance to prove how much I love YOU.. and as I am standing there and I am waiting.. I would  see YOU walking.. and YOU stop by the Door.. holding Your Heart.. I would look at YOU.. the smile on Your Heart.. so Beautiful.. YOU are so Beautiful.. wearing a Dress.. Like a True Princess.. YOU are.. as I would watch Your Hand Unlock.. my Hand grabbing the Message in the Bottle.. I see Your Hand Grab the Bottle.. and I see you locked the Door.. as I am standing there.. YOU turn to walk away and stand in the center.. I see you pull the Letter Out.. and My hand touch my Heart.. this is the reason I am here.. this is the reason why I came.. it does not matter.. as long as the Message.. My Love gets to Your First.. as long as I love YOU FIRST.. and YOU can love me later On.. it does Not matter.. it is this WHY I CAME.. waiting for this very day.. and I am looking through the Glass Wall.. I see YOU and Your Heart reading the Letter.. This is what I wrote.. I love you.. the three letter words.. it only can come from my Heart.. I wanted to tell YOU this for a Long Long Long Long time.. but there was no way I could tell YOU this.. living miles and miles and miles away.. How am I suppose to tell YOU these three letter words.. only the Picture that was with me and if YOU are asking me where did I get the picture.. someway somehow it just came to me.. I remember looking at Your picture.. I would wonder.. when Can I see YOU.. where can",
