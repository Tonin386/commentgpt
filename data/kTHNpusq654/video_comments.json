        "text": "Watching the video, I've decided I like this song and it is very relatable for anyone who has dated (especially women dating men). But there was a line about him being a \"love bipolar,\" or something like that and as someone with bipolar, it pisses me off when people use the illness to describe people who can't make up their mind. That's not what bipolar is, and it's not a personality disorder. It is a mood disorder and you choose how to respond to those moods. Sometimes I'm manic and it used to mean I would be really productive and cheerful and peppy and a long manic episode got me on the Dean's List in university. Then depression comes out of nowhere, like I'm burnt out from the mania and I feel everything so deeply like I'm an open wound. But my opinions don't change like my moods do, in no way am I an indecisive person and I don't believe there is a mental illness that describes that, but he could be borderline, I guess.",

She literally ran down the street chasing him like a maniac, then stole someone's bike to keep chasing him, then she and her \"gang\" of bridesmaids show up armed with baseball bats ready to physically assault him.\n\nThough I do have to wonder why he stayed with an insane woman like that to the point where he was even standing at the altar with her in the first place. \ud83e\udd14\n\nSo I bet he'll live to regret the decision he makes at the end of the video",

Go to hell CTU and thanks for the act and purposely refusing to fix my phone.\n\nBlame joy Harding, Lisa Egan, Miley, Robyn from NCIS and your AI can't get your stories straight and it's over some bot you always ignore vs preventing this which means you're no different than the enemy you proclaim to fight.\n\nThe real enemy is which one is competing against you doing the same thing. Right Sam or was I right? Eight. I see.\n\nThst was last week. So this is called play head games over Monaco and Miley being arrested and don't do a damn thing for me but I'm in danger. Right Lorna? Your the DI? Say something! You can tell 60 minutes but not me? Hmmm\n\nI smell bullshit and I think you Lorna walmsley are as crooked.",
