        "text": "The first part of the song represents the nostalgic past, our childhood, the innocence and simplicity of our memories. This is exemplified by the simple fun lyrics like \"rollie on my wrist\" reminding us of the a time when things werent do serious and it was just about having fun, we were certain about the future, and world was a simple place. The transition to the second half the song takes us out of the past into the now where have to face the harsh reality. This is why Travis asks us to look at his eyes so we can see how much he has changed, things become more complex and nuanced we can see he's not the immature person he once used to be but he's gonna keep getting at it.",

Rich and \nEvil dudes try to diminish me. \nThey can\u2019t finish me. Snitching \nFails. Justice prevails \nWhen my gun stops glitching. \nI love b\u2026tching \nWhen sorrow irritates me. \nI go crazy. Hell awaits thee. \nFires are ama-ama-amazing. \nEnemies burn in my crematorium. \nIt\u2019s a sad story and I get dic-dic-dictatorial. \nRevenge creeps under my corium. \nI speak Vic-vic-victorian when I pull the trigger. \nMy shadow gets big-big-bigger in my crematorium-orium-orium\u2026 \n \n[Verse 1] \nThoughts attack me exactly when demons try to whack me. \nRelatives don\u2019t back me because they envy me. Frankly, \nI hate \u2018em too. F\u2026ck my shaky roots! They won\u2019t make it. Boots \nFall on \u2018em. Laudanum is all they drink to think like a murderer. \nI order-order rum to drown my sorrow. Run away from \nThe horror. Fun is a rare guest. I do my best to earn a dollar. Slum \nIs my home town. When I wanna glow crowds \nLaugh and get slow. Chow is cold now. Hungry like a mole. Out \nFor weeks. Gnats bite my cheeks. I feel bad like creeps. \nDragons fly. Deeds pile up like beats. Cops die on streets. \nBut I don\u2019t care. I wanna grow. Lairs make me vomit like a crow. Dare \nSpeak the truth after chic booze. I live under snow. Mares \nI feed on help me grow. Bear a grudge against the dope mayor. \nI know-know the truth is out there. \n \n[Chorus] \nThoughts in my head. Thoughts in my head. \nDemons gonna jump-jump. \nMemory\u2019s dead. Memory\u2019s dead. \nSparrows drinking blood-blood. \n \n[Verse 2] \nTalking to the mirror. I ain\u2019t a hero. They call me Loser, man! \nThat\u2019s why I get woozy. Pen is my sword I like to use again. \nA pussy\u2019s phlegm makes me sick. That\u2019s a crazy flick. \nP\u2026rn is amazing sh\u2026t. When I get lazy, a hit \nDispels my wistfulness. I miss-miss fool pests. \nI never eat to the full. Jest to revive my mood. Yes. \nI burn a fool\u2019s nest when I steal some cool eggs. \nIf Hunger whispers, I do whatever it wants. Woo \nPretty b\u2026tches to get richer like Wu. \nPlay and mix blues when chicks snooze. \nI give \u2018em bricks. Lose myself in Eminem\u2019s music. \nI crave for a happy end. My bang crew\u2019s sick \nLike bachelor John Cusack. F\u2026ck the society! \nGonna be a star. Firing bazookas. Lucas inspires me \nTo write stories fuelled by anxiety when bastards dehire me. \nI get high and dream of islands. Shooting vipers \nIs fun. Spooky spiders, go home! Leave me alone. \nGonna make my groupie ride me. \n \n[Chorus] \nThoughts in my head. Thoughts in my head. \nDemons gonna jump-jump. \nMemory\u2019s dead. Memory\u2019s dead. \nSparrows drinking blood-blood. \n \n[Verse 3] \nMy life is an endless alphabet. Idiots keep laughing at \nMy f\u2026ck-ups. Madhouse understaffing and \nEmptiness cause my laughter. At\u2026 large \nLike Burrows. My arrows keep attacking rats \nWho live in the jungle shacks. They die of hunger. Gnats \nBite \u2018em too. My crew can juggle bats. \nDinosaurs in the tunnel. Max goes mad \nBecause of getting fungal. Axe after axe. \nTheir heads bangle. Cats chase Bob\u2019s uncles. Vats \nFull of sharks and brats. Enjoy the jungle, lads! \nSwords punish foes. Ghosts vanish. Gross. \nI ain\u2019t uppish. Show ain\u2019t over. I\u2019m a soldier. \nGonna break your nose. Sorry for my sad story. Gore \nOn my hands. Blast lorries. Law is toilet paper. \nHatred\u2019s victims galore. War after war. \nVirtual reality bothers me. You don\u2019t cure mentality. \nSo I dally-dally. D wanna placate me. They hate me. \nBrutality is a loco\u2019s path. Tread on the broken glass. \nK\u2026ll bogans. Dust and locals\u2019 ash make me laugh \nLike Joker Slash. \n \n[Chorus] \nThoughts in my head. Thoughts in my head. \nDemons gonna jump-jump. \nMemory\u2019s dead. Memory\u2019s dead. \nSparrows drinking blood-blood. \n \n[Outro] Policeman: \nGood evening, mam! We\u2019ve found a guy who claims to be a founder. Why \nDid you release \u2018im? His reason is sick. He offered me a brick. \nParamedics fixed his fried chick. \nPsychiatrists will help your son recover. \nHe says that he is undercover. \nHe chases demons who killed his lover. \nIs Rihanna your son\u2019s wife? \nIs he playing with a big knife? \nMam, I think your son is tripping. He should be sipping \nSome syrup in a madhouse. \nNo. There is neither a mouse nor a louse. Mam, your son will forget such bouts. \nPlease don\u2019t worry! He will be treated in the best madhouse-house-house. \n \n\u00a9 Norfum 2023.",

        "text": "My eyes by Travis Scott is a genius song. \n\nIt shows the weak vs the strong mind in the two parts. The weak sounds shaky and the pace is slow, it feels like the insecure side of travis. It also focuses a lot on materialistic things - \u201c\u2026Ten thousand on my eyes\u201d. \n\nThen Sampha shows the mind evolving, gaining confidence with the clarity of voice, even more so with the beat picking up pace afterwards. \n\nFinally, the strong mind spits, talking fast and clear, and speaking on vulnerabilities. Weak travis talks about covering his eyes with his wealth while strong says \u201cLook in my eyes\u201d directly, essentially facing his deepest fears and/or demons. \n\nHe talks about the events at the Astroworld festival and his break up(s). <- \u201cMake a cast of my dick so she never gon cheat.\u201d \n\nThe \u201cwait till the smoke clears out of my face\u201d is proof of reliance on vices - he isn\u2019t perfect = \u201cam I picture perfect or do I look high?\u201d Follows this and encapsulates this well.\n\nI think the ending of the second part is just the cherry on the top though. \n\nThe way Travis speaks on his material possessions, then intertwines it into the fast paced, hectic life that he is painting for us is brilliant: \n\n\u201cBought the crib on a hill\u201d = \u201charder to reach\u201d \n\u201cBought a couple more whips\u201d = \u201cneeded more speed\u201d \n\nMore watches for more time and so on. It\u2019s a fantastic way of not just linking aspects of his life and lifestyle, but also linking the two parts of the songs. \n\nAnd then the final bar: \n\n\u201cIf I gave you a day in my life of a day in my eyes, don\u2019t blink.\u201d\u2026 \ud83e\udd0c\n\nAll of this paired with the heavenly production easily makes this one of my favourite songs. \n\nWhether or not this was all the idea of Travis or my high ass reaching for the stars with this, tbh, I don\u2019t give a shit. Just love the song. Good stuff \ud83d\udc4d.",
