Well, I've recently started listening to his songs, mainly his acoustics... all I have to say is, wow, I've been missing out. This is why we should never judge a book by its cover, why you shouldn't listen to what other people have to say about someone, why we shouldn't base how we feel about someone/something off of someone else's feelings/opinions towards something/someone.
