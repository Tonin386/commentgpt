I bought a T shirt from a guy who was selling cheap T shirts and the only reason I bought the shirt was because it was Taylor Swift picture he was flying around with. It was the only one he had left. I was so lucky and wanted to know what that means. To me I think it meant that one day I will meet her that is before I die. I turn 46 years old last week Thursday 7th September. I really am madly in love with all her albums, literally all her albums. I scream to the top of my lungs without caring who don't care. I pray I meet her one day. I pray that she wants to know who I am. My baby is 7 years old and also a big fan because of me. Ms. Swift If I ever get to meet you or just a phone call, I will die tomorrow very happy woman.",
