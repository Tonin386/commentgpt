If i had 3 wishes then 1 would be to just meet a woman as amazing as you and have a real conversation. Just to get to know the real lady gaga. You inspire alot of people. THANK YOU. I will forever think of my gf when I hear this song. I cry when I hear this b/c I know she was in so much pain emotionally the day she past away. But I cant not listen to your song. I just wish she would have leaned on my and held my hand. I struggle to go on and need true friends who care about me. You aare super famous and I dont expect you to respond. I just wanted to thank you for your music. I really just wanted to find someone who I could have an intelligent and interesting conversation. you are an unbelievable singer and actress. You seem sooooo real compared to so many others who sing and act. I would never ask to meet you. I know you aare so beyond famous. I just want you to knowj your music is AMAZING. Sorry if this was a bother. Thank you and GOODBYE. ILL NEVER MESSAGE YOU AGAIN MISS GAGA. Keep inspiring others.",

Your music have helped me a lot.

I LOVE \u201cbad romance\u201d, \u201calejando\u201d, \u201cpoker face\u201d\u2026 and so goes on\u2026\nYou cannt wonder how gratefull I would be\u2026 \u201c I am not tired, I am a superstar\u201d.\nHope you understand and you and your team may help me \u2764\nFrom the bottom of the heart of your little monster, thanks in advance \u2764\u2764\u2764\nBruno (you can reffer to me as \u201cBuh\u201d)",

It truly makes me feel of the very person whom has been standing by me when I have been through so much emotional and psychological trauma in the past four years. I have verbally lashed out at this person more times than I care to count but they have stood by my side knowing I am not mad at them but just in tremendous pain. Thanks to this beautiful woman, I have found peace and forgiveness and she has forgiving me for my many negative traits I have had. This song truly puts me in tears every time, such a beautiful and amazing song.",

Lady Gaga, and knowing by the end of this movie Maverick is now a changed man has fought his demons and is now with the love of his life. And honestly if Tom Cruise were to retire but do 1 last movie and finish his career with a bang this would've been the movie to do it. Damn I love this movie. 10/10 \ud83d\ude4c",

        "text": "It is nice in rural Upstate New York if you are a tourist with lots of money to spend at the tourist sites in the country/rural geographic areas. the people are nice. It is a poverty-stricken geographic area. Some people don't have electricity because Social Services doesn't help them in the ways that they should. Some people don't have septic tanks in rural Upstate New York and Social Services doesn't help them in the ways that they should or could. Social Services in rural Upstate New York only help who they want and when they want. Rural Upstate New York would be a better place to live IF New York City took over and ran its courts and police departments and Social Services. If rural Upstate New York did stuff similar to the ways that New York City does, then rural Upstate New York would financially have a lot more. If they did stuff similar to the ways that Blacks and Hispanics do then everyone would have more. More financial aid from the Federal government is needed in rural Upstate New York and also in New York City. The Federal government has to give more financial aid to all citizens in the United States and Puerto Rico. \n\nIt is sad to live in rural geographic areas because they don't do that much economic development or community revitalization. They don't make it easy for me to stay living here where I live and that is frustrating. I don't have that much family which I already sent you emails and information about. If they made things easier for me then maybe I might enjoy living here where I live but that is not what they seem to have in mind for me. I can barely afford to live here where I live. My sadness is from the poverty that I live in. In New York City I would be living in poverty too but there is a different mindset and different ways of thinking in New York City. \n\nThe large corporation that put the trailer park here in rural Upstate New York means well but the way that they do stuff in rural Upstate New York causes poverty and there are lots of empty lots and empty trailers in the trailer parks in the rural Upstate New York geographic areas because the local small towns don't like larger corporations. Almost everyone has to have SSI which is Supplemental Secuirty Income from the Social Security Administration and public assistance to pay rent and buy food and pay for transportation. \n\n\nI am only one person and I appreciate the JoLo email with the lighter and happier things. I can the sadness on Jennifer Lopez's face. I can see the sadness on Ben Affleck's face. It is challenging to be divorced. It is challenging to have children. It can be stressful to have children from two different spouses together. I pray for Ben and Jen and their kids. \n\nI am only one person and I would gladly move to be with a group of people with who I could live together or work together. Or live in a large one-room studio apartment and go to a place to work for very little pay in a larger city. I would do something similar to what Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck are doing if I could. \n\nI would go to the gym almost every day if I could. I would go swimming almost every day if I could. A would find people who I could do group events with such as book clubs and more fun activities. Maybe find an interdenominational church to go to. Licensed Social Workers who provide counseling are also in New York City too. \n\nIt is okay to documentary films about the Holocaust and Child Brides and stuff from World War 2. But I don't want to sit around here in this trailer park for the rest of my life. A lot of people ask about my prior background and I have sent information so they can verify information about my prior background. I don't mind looking back at the past and how the past impacts why we are the way we are today in the month of April 2023. The past is why things are the ways that they are now in the year 2023. But I would also like to move forward in my life and I don't see that happening yet. To me, it seems like stagnation. \n\n\nI don't like living way up here in rural Upstate New York because it is like living in the bible belt and they pray to a dead man whose name is Jesus. Jesus was murdered. Jesus did not choose to die. So they pray to a dead man whose name is Jesus because why? They pray to a dead man that was murdered because why? It is okay to pray to Jesus. I am not making fun of people who pray to Jesus. People have different religions. Thumping bibles. \n\nI lived in New York City from 1994 to 2006 and would gladly move back to New York City and stay in New York City for the rest of my life if I could. A one-room studio apartment in New York City sounds excellent to me. Why a one-room studio apartment? Because it is very expensive to live in New York City so a one-room studio apartment for a single person because I don't have that much family. I don't have children. I won't have grandchildren because I didn't have children. Unless miracles happen. Praying for God's amazing grace miracles. Maybe I could travel to Italy too if I lived in New York City. I like Italy too. I like Europe and European things.",
