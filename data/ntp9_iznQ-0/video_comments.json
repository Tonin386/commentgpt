I look at who he has dated, who he had a child with and who he likes to link up with. He seems to want a relationship that is very private and monogamous but also flexible to his needs as a celebrity. He gives Janet Jackson type vibes, she married that rich, traditional Muslim Arab man, had a baby but also wants her American career as an entertainer and the freedom to be herself. Drake seems similar, I think they both need to talk to Oprah. Cause Stedman Graham is his own factor and he and Oprah stay happy together, 40 years strong. Drake doesn\u2019t need to be rescued, he just needs to calm down and live as life comes. Focus on his art/business and accept the goodness that comes to him in his personal life. His right companion will avail themselves as he is receptive.",
