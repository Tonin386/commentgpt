It\u2019s a clever and catchy way to point out the senseless things we do as Americans seemingly because we think it will get us ahead or simply because we are followers. Afraid to imagine a different life where we weren\u2019t all competing for what turns out often to be useless material things that can\u2019t bring lasting contentment. And we are chained to the rat race (rhythm) just to keep from losing what we worked to attain. \nYes, there must be more to life than this. If we can\u2019t move past this greedy mindset, then the time is ticking for the empire.",

The rest of us will live in the new world and wait for the false Antichrist who will perform great miracles. Advice to every infidel, perhaps you should read about Islam because it is the only salvation and it is the true religion for that world order that wants to obliterate it but they cannot because they defy the allah, You must read about Islam, perhaps you will know the truth, and we are not here to suffer, perish, wage wars, or hate each other.",

        "text": "There are sooo many (subliminal) messages in this video and I'd love to share my interpretation of them.\nSo, she's in Oblivia, which speaks for itself as oblivious. Then at 24 seconds you have the ladies being on their tablets, taking photos while glues to their screens - speaking to the theme of technology addiction. \nAt 33 seconds we see the American Dream Drop, speaking to the concept of how the American dream is just an illusion, and it has a arrow going down - maybe speaking to the stock marketing and its \"crashes?\"\nAt :38 she cuts her hand and perhaps this pain bursts the bubble she had been living in. The pain put her out of her trance and into the actual reality. Maybe a similar metaphor for when Siddhartha left the palace at age 29 to seek the end of suffering after having become aware of the concept. \nAt 1:20 there's a tunnel with a bunch of social media reactions, and in the next scene the ride goes on a heart-shaped loop - signifying that we crave this validation from others and think we are \"loved\" when validated on social media. \nThen everyone is just marching in line, on rhythm. This whole concept could reflect on the music industry itself and how it brainwashes us into liking or believing in certain things without us even noticing it. Or it could also be speaking to the powers that be in general and how they put us under a certain trance-like state to be insecure, incomplete, and complacent. \nAt 1:47 there is a ride that's called \"No Place like Home;\" this one is a bit more unclear to me, but it seems to me like maybe it's about suicide because the ride just throws people off and it doesn't give any further insight as to what happens to them.\nAt 1:52, there is a ride called bombs away, speaking to the military industrial complex and how it's been so normalized.\nThen at 2:00 there is a hamster wheel, which could signify that we are all just running in a never-ending circle, wasting our lives away until we get so tired that we crash. Or could also represent the struggle of being a minority. \nAt 2:11 there is a station called inferno h2o, which is my favorite message in this video. At first I thought maybe it was speaking to the fossil fuel industry overall, but then I realized it might also be speaking of the concept of alcohol. Alcohol is also literally fuel and people drink it as if it's meant to be consumed when in reality it is a poison that we try to make taste yummy by adding sugar. Also she mentions \"wasted zombie,\" which could also be referring to alcohol. \nIt seems like everyone is in the movie theater watching the different people fail at running the hamster wheel, as if other people's failures are a sort of entertainment, and everyone gets a chance at being embarrassed (since people line up for their turn). \nThe Skip Marley part speaks for itself - Break out of the prison that has been built for you. \nAt the end, she runs the hamster wheel herself though she does not fall down with it, perhaps breaking people away from that type of entertainment, or that type of norm where you just keep working working working or going going going until you fall, making them uncomfortable in their bubbles which may domino into something else. \n\nThanks for reading if you got through all of this :) LOL",
