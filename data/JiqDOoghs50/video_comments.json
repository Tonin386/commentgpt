She was the best person I've ever met, the kindest woman. I was lucky to grow by her side, my heart broke the moment I knew she passed, and I wasn't there, now I have to learn to live without her, with hurt heart, knowing that when I go to her house to visit, she won't be there. This song hits right to the heart for those who have lost someone they loved. Hope all of you there can find comfort at some point, and live a life that make you, and the person you loved so deeply, very proud.\nI know I'll try... my dear grandma will be proud.",

The narrow way to life (Heaven). If you are still on the broad road, you are in serious danger.

Take me into your loving arms.\" \n\nStep 2 Keep the basic notes, chords and rhythm, but change the lyrics to make them tragic instead of happy. \n  answer: \"Life Goes On.\"  hook: \"So tell me how. How our life goes on with you gone.\"\n\nStep 3 No one can sue you now because you copied yourself. Sit back and collect your royalties! \n\nBravo sir!",
