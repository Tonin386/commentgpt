        "text": "Adele, you were absolutely STUNNING, GORGEOUS AND BEYOND THE MEANING OF TALENT FROM DAY ONE! Although I'm glad you are healthier and maybe feeling better about yourself, nothing changes how beautiful you've always been! I sincerely hope you have found someone who loves and appreciates you for YOU, regardless of your worst or best day, your lowest or highest state of being, on the floor dying from Satans evil or living the absolute best life God blessed you floating in the clouds! God Bless You Adele......you are a gift to the world from GOD!!! THE ONE AND ONLY GOD! However, it saddens me knowing that most super famous and wealthy successful beautiful people today had to make a HUGE sacrifice to get to the level you are now at. Look, I know EVERYTHING about selling your soul to Satan for success and riches and fame, regardless of how talented you are. Almost NOBODY that is famous reaches thier level of super stardom without signing thier name in blood directly to Satan......If this is what you have done, Adele, and there is very little doubt in my mind that you have participated in this, and if you have, then you surely know by now what Satan wants in return, and hopefully see how evil and demonic the industry, Hollywood and most of the worlds governments are......but please hear me.....SATAN LIED TO YOU, YOU CANNOT SELL YOUR SOUL BECAUSE YOUR SOUL BELONGS TO GOD. THATS WHY WHEN SATAN ASKS YOU TO SELL YOUR SOUL, HE INSISTS THAT YOU TURN YOU BACK ON GOD AND TO MOCK AND SLANDER JESUS EVERY CHANCE YOU GET........ because Satan knows his end is coming soon, and that he WILL BE defeated.....but his evil goal is and has been to deceive as many of God's children as possible to turn their backs on God and to live in all the sin possible so that when Judgement day comes he can bring as many of us as possible with him to hell .....to burn and suffer with him for eternity. Please people, brothers, sisters, fellow REAL CHRISTIANS, Please wake up, repent, get you and everyone you know right with God because make No MISTAKE, WE ARE IN THE END TIMES!!!! And things for real Christians are very soon going to become very similar to WW2 Holocaust but in STEROIDS!!!! But we must remain strong, and fearless and NEVER WAIVER in our faith in Jesus Christ NO MATTER WHAT!!! Our lives have been kindergarten level safe and painless compared to what we will soon endure just for being Christians. We will be tortured and viciously murdered in front of billions of non believers......but this will be our true and final test from GOD.....And if we fail and denounce God, we will go to hell with everyone else.....but if we TRULY love and TRUST in God, HE will guide us through these horrible times and we will be rewarded UNIMAGINABLELY for staying strong, not giving into Satans LIES and fear, and praising God until our last breath!!! HALLELUJAH!!!! I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS DAY!!!! TO SACRIFICE MYSELF FOR HIM, TO EVEN BE ABLE TO BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND, APPRECIATE AND RECIPROCATE JESUS' ULTIMATE SACRIFICE FOR US!!!! It will also be so uplifting to know that VERY SOON Jesus will be returning and setting everything right in the universe!!! PRAISE JESUS!!! PLEASE COME SOON!!!!",

All good to move forward.  She left a book behind, she still wrote like a 7 year old or six year old like when they all started hitting her.  I asked for words of encouragement, the words were too much I suppose.  Murderers hate being called out on premeditated manipulation and torture of lives.   Nazi war criminals still hiding, if I am you I'll know you and you won't have time to be terrified.  Not a second thought, JESUS.forgave amd look what they kept wanting to do.  My GOD is perfect, people here throw him away.  They should have been afraid.",
