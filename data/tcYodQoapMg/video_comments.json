Because I shouted a few words on the street! I opposed saving democracy with one word! Then the Chinese government arrested me! No Tell me about any rights I have! They took me into the police station and surrounded me with 5 people! Asked for my account password! Then they illegally hacked my account and were about to delete my account! I asked them why they deleted my account !They started verbally abusing me! You coward! You still want to beat me! I was so scared! I could only cooperate with them, and I would answer whatever they asked! Then they put me in a cell full of excrement A stench! Tortured me mentally! Later they took me into the interrogation room! Turned the air conditioner to the lowest temperature and tortured me with the cold! They also asked me to answer leading questions! They wanted to aggravate my crime! Just yelled a few words, shot a 37-second video and uploaded it to YouTube! They put me in a black jail! When I was locked up by them, no one could help me! I was helpless and sad! It turns out Freedom of speech, equality and democracy in China are all fakes! Their rich second generation surnamed Wang beat someone up and released him without charge! Instead, he just yelled a few words! They will be locked up in a stinking black prison full of excrement! I'm very sad! Let me see the dark side of the Chinese government! I don't know who they followed the instructions of their superiors to put me in a black jail! But I know who has such rights in China! I hope more people can see My Story! Save Chinese Democracy!",

All 5 of her younger siblings \n\nThank U, Next (2019) \n~ AGE: 19\n~RELATION: 2nd oldest sister \n~PERSONALITY: The most outgoing sibling who spends every late night out with her friends partying and drinking during the night. During the day, she\u2019s the most introverted sibling who\u2019s to herself and is always there for who ever needs advice regarding relationships. \n~ CLOSEST TO? Sweetener \n\nSweetener (2018)\n~AGE: 18\n~RELATION: 3rd oldest sister \n~PERSONALITY : The most chill sibling of them all and tends to be the sweetest as well. She always obeys her older sisters and is very respectful towards her younger siblings as well. She spoils her younger siblings and spends as much as quality time with her older sisters. Whenever someone is sad, she\u2019s always there to sing a sweet lullaby to cheer them up.\n~CLOSEST TO?

Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men\n10 nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.\n11 And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.\nHebrews 13:4 Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral.\nRomans 1:26-28\n26 Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones.\n27 In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.\n28 Furthermore, just as they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, so God gave them over to a depraved mind, so that they do what ought not to be done.",
