She always does, and all the while moving around, dancing & performing. It\u2019s like she\u2019s got endless lungs. Never have I seen an artist with such meticulous control and every evolving style\u2014especially love how she takes creative license in real time when performing her songs. Not one is like the other. I swear she can create like 10 amazing different versions  of 1 song .",
