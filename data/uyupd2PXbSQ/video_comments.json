The girl , lets say Maisy opened the door and he saw a 10 year old boy.\n\nHe said \" um hello, im your new neighbor, my mom said to deliver some ice cream to you guys.. \" \n\n\" hello im maisy! thats so sweet of your mother, your 10 right? im 8, whats ur name? \"\n\n\" my name is shiro. nice to meet you !\" Maisy said the same too.. when maisy finishes her homework she always asks permission to go to shiro's house to play with him and to get to know him well..\n\nUntil one day, it suddenly stopped. She stopped doing it, because Shiro had problems with her grandmother-father situation, so they had to move to another country because their house near to maisy's is near to their grandmas house.\n\n8 years later...\n\nMaisy is 16 now and she had many friends and is grown up and grew up kind and pretty. She is popular and top 1 at their school and a reprasentative. But theres also a big secret shes holding from her mom..\n\nMaisy has stage 3 cancer and she only has 20 weeks to live.. the doctor said sorry and live her life the best. She also didnt say snything to her friends.\n\nOne day they had a school transfer,  proffessor matteo introduced him to the class, his name was Shiro. He was 18 years old and his parents got divorced. He was ordered to sit by Maisy.\n\nMaisy said in her mind \" why is this new kid shiro look so familiar? and his style, name, and age gap and face is also very familiar? \" as Maisy was curious she didnt realize she was deeply staring at Shiro for a very long time.\n\nShiro said, \" have we met? you kinda look familiar? also the same name as my child hood best friend.. god i miss her:( \"\n\n2 weeks passed and maisy and shiro became very good friends again. Maisy was so happy she completely forgot about her cancer.\n\nShe only has 18 weeks to live now, its still far. Shiro also noticed maisy always coughing, sore throats, and coughing blood.\n\nIt wasnt good for maisy as shiro knows. So he asked and maisy asked where he got that information.\n\nPart 2?? Like for prt.2!!\n<33",

Same lyrics, different energies and different feelings but if I were to choose I will choose the original one.",

Never had someone who hasn\u2019t cheated on me for the entire relationship. I hate that i can connect to it in this way\nLast time i heard this song was when i was still a kid. I wonder if my kid self would like to see the person i have become. For him to know that something I\u2019ve always yearned for was the right women and i to find one another my first go at it. Would he be happy that i failed",

Maybe right now I'm too scared, but I hope someday I can truly and fully express my thoughts and how I adore you from the very beginning. I thought you were hard to be friends with, turns out it's harder for me to be just friends with you. I was mesmerized meeting you, so even if we broke apart, hope you'll still remember me. Don't be inlove with someone else please... we both knew that we had feelings for each other, but we're too young for this time. Hope we'll realize someday, how compatible are we to each other. Even if we'll fall apart, may destiny cross our path again, and start all over again. I promise, I will not waste this opportunity being with you. I love you, in all ways, my always.",

They describe the feeling of being in the same room as this person, a \u201ctired, lonely place\u201d that has become filled with emotion and warmth when they meet. The narrator talks about feeling wonderstruck and enchanted to meet this person, wishing that this is the start of a love story rather than its concluding chapter. They pray to not have anyone else fill their heart and plead for the chance to be together. Taylor Swift\u2019s song encourages the listener to take a chance and take joy in the delightful moments found in life.",

It didnt lead to anything after that. If I'm not wrong  they never really confessed to each other about their feelings . However the fact that she wrote this song about him and him also revealing later to the media that he also was crushing on her AND made a cover of enchanted shows that somewhere sometime there were sparks flying ..and really strong sparks..but idk why they didnt take this friendship up to the next level.Their story is like that girl/guy ypu see on the street who you are really drawn to but you know woull never be with them and it tugs on your heart",

She stood out there in my neighbour so beautiful and as calm as ever walking past me with her eyes down as always. Tho she was never my neighbor I never felt anything was off as it was a dream. As she walk past me the ME in my dream was also a part of me and subsequently had a feeling of awkwardness and a strong feeling of devotion with a little bit of sadness.Then after that I'm pretty sure she walk past me one more time and this time she looked at me but only with her head down. How beautiful her eyes we're. Long lashes with her big eyes only partly visible due her facing down and looking a bit up to glare at me with only with embarrassment.Then there as we somehow happened to meet outside after few mins saw her little sister maybe of around 12 driving a car. It was weird but a dream. She drove pretty well for a 12 yr old kid. Then she told me \"only I can sit while my sister is driving \", I was pretty amazed her sister could drive a car and that word added more amazement in my head.She was but a kid, she started to lose balance and I had to handle it. It was not hardwork i jz had to hit the brakes as it was moving ahead on its own. This scene was maybe my desire to impress her. But i never heard anything from her there.Maybe an indication that she talked less. Then there I saw this little embarrassment in her eyes and throwing a letter at me told \" This is my reply \".Here it connects my dream to the reality where I had given her a letter in school and she never sent a reply back. I already had an idea what her reply would be (obviously a turndown) was but excited. Then I had put it in my pocket and had decided to read when i was free. Going down stairs I met my mom she had seen through me and asked hows it going between us only for me to reply that I didn't know. I can still imagine how beautiful she looked in my mind while I was answering my mom. And then i never opened the letter in my dream. Maybe another indication that I never got a reply from her.",

So in highschool we were very close to a point where we started playing with our PSPs together during our breaks like almost all our times at school was either we studied together or played. I soon developed a crush on him and back then I was straight as all hell, but idk I just sorta felt really really anxious or maybe giddy whenever I was near him, we both share our love for anime, and offensive humor lol. I guess I was \"Enchanted\" by him then and even still now. We're almost close to our thirties, he's already got a long term gf now, and I did tell him about how I had a crush on him years ago and we both laughed it off. This song is bringing back memories of how close we were back then and how I still really yearn for him even tho it's obviously impossible, but I am just glad that he's at least happy with his boo thang haha...",

        "text": "My dear Rami, there was once a moment many years ago. I barely knew you and in the moment I stopped to gaze at you\u2026my mind questioned if there was a love already in your heart. I thought to myself that there was almost no chance that this amazing man was without a special lady in his life. Desperately I wished your heart was not already taken. I figured it was wishful thinking and decided to keep you as a crush. Life certainly had other plans for us\u2026I love you now with all of my soul. I would wait for you another lifetime and then again just to see your friendly gaze across the room. \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\udc9a",

Adam Young then realized that the song is about him and also later Adam recorded and released his own version of \"Enchanted\" as a direct response to Taylor and actually replied to a certain lyrics of the song so he added the line \"I was never in love with someone else, I never had somebody waiting on me 'cause you were all of my dreams come true\". \nUnfortunately, Taylor ghosted Adam after he released his own version of the song. You can search in YouTube for you to hear.\n\nPS:  They had a thing but never dated.",
