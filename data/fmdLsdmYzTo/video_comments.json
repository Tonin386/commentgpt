        "text": "THOUGHTS ON RAP MUSIC\n\nMusic is a beautiful blend of order and chaos. The beat is order. It is predicatble, and after the first 10-20 second, you \u201cget the beat\u201d without having to know the lyrics. The lyrics represent chaos and they are unpredictable (of course until we memorize them). The harmonious blend is what makes music addictive. The beat is order, the lyrics are chaos \u2014 and you need both to make a masterpiece. \n\nWhy do some people think certain music is \u201cbad.\u201d The generation behind me (my parents) despise rap in any shape or form, even if the message is \u201cgood\u201d. It\u2019s like they just can get past the fact that it often focuses on trauma and overcoming adversity in the world, perhaps they cannot relate? The reality is that I don\u2019t relate to a lot of rap either, but I like it because the beats are straight heat/fire, the flow patterns and play on words are so clever, and the messages express the full range of human emotion (excitement, happiness, anger, sadness, fear, joy, etc)\n\nIsn\u2019t music just an art form like any other? Why are we prosecuting artists for lyrics in their song, its just a song and a way of expression, some of it may be true, but that does not mean it is all true. \n\nTheater \u2014 Shakepear\u2019s playwrights had far more inappropriate language but that is an okay art form. \nActing \u2014 Hollywood movies have actors killing other people, but it\u2019s just a movie and we can separate a movie from reality, right?\nPainting \u2014 Have you ever seen \u201cThe Garden of Earthly Delights\u201d by Renaissance artist, Bosch \u2014 we can appreciate that as art\n\nThese rappers are literally just artists and have creative minds and music is an outlet for their thoughts. they even have STAGE names. Like Drake\u2019s name is AUBREY, most people know that right? \n\nMy guess is rap has been stigmatized because white people don\u2019t want to listen to the struggles or triumphs of black people, and they disguise their agenda by saying it has poo poo pee pee naught words and thats inappropriate. Is it? It is not self-evident to me why that would be inappropriate. Do the movies you see have  \u201cinappropriate words?\u201d You don\u2019t have to like or enjoy rap. But just realize that you disdain to it likely stems from ignorance and a refusal to see it for what it is \u2014 art",

        "text": "I think that this song hits so close because... It feels close. Travis is a master at producing, and he made his voice feel like someone is speaking very near to you. Also, the voice has all this little effects (whispers, panning, pitching it down, then up, reverb that lasts just for a few seconds and seems to get lost, leaving you wondering about whats happening) that tickle your brain, keeping it interesting throughout the song. I think his great ear and musical instinct is his bigger strength. \nNow, i say this without exalting him to the point of exaggeration, but for these reasons, this is great music.",

Mm\nTellin' you just how I feel right now\nYou say it's just the drugs, and I know\nI know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know\nI lied too, way before (Let's go), before\nBefore I had you right inside my arms\nBut then again, I can be drunk",
