There is rlly no point in arguing about who\u2019s better because obviously, everyone has their own opinion. I think it\u2019s really childish to go out of your way to spread hate on someone else.

However this is not against Ms. Swift, I've never liked or found her prior work pleasing with the sappy love ans breakup songs and again however, I do believe Tay Tay finally gets it. I have with agree and a 100% with her lyrical talent that she is beyond amazing with this song. As an upcoming writer she is incredible with her wording and realism within the context of using her position to voice, act and portray events in her life; much as in the same with my writing. Thank You Taylor for being a light in the darkness.",
