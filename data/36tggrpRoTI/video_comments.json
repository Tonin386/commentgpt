Hope and peace it sends to you, the sky aren\u00b4t grey, they turn to blue. And when you wake up, the world has changed and all your pains are rearranged. So live your life, enjoy it well don\u00b4t think about going to hell. Relish every moment and every hour, and it will grow and stay like a flower.

I don\u00b4t know it any more, my power is gone and I\u00b4m losing my fight. Everything goes wrong and nothing goes right.

Had to come listen to it with a new perspective and don't know how I never saw it. As a recovering drug addict 4 years sober, I clearly never really \"heard\" this song. Just memorized the lyrics and listened to it. Enjoyed it. But didn't hear it. I am hearing it so much better now.",

If you truly appreciate the song, the lyrics, the artist, and most importantly can personally relate to the struggle he's singing about, the video falls by the wayside. Grow up and comment on something that is worthy of commenting. I was teleported by the lyrics and the emotion, I didn't honestly pay attention to the video until the 2nd listen. I grew up with the introduction of MTV and came home from school to listen to my favorite music in video form but I don't rely on the video to provide me the audio comfort I was seeking when I searched it out. Hell half the time I'm interpreting something different than what is in the video.",

I\u2019m so happy because this song explains how I feel more than I can seem to and I feel like I\u2019m less alone or \u201ccrazy\u201d like I know I\u2019m not crazy for being anxious but the way people react to me makes me feel like I am sometimes.

Only reality points to THE ONE TRUE GOD. So , why on earth are we adding Christianity among the religions? Arent there 2 different masters? - one cam to redeem us all and the other to corrupt us even further. And dose not the bible clears out why not to serve 2 masters and the reasons why one can\u00b4t serve 2 masters, (GOD AND MAMMON) but must maker a choosing. For it is foolish to assume that to serve satan - we will get heaven and to serve GOD - hell is guaranteed. We cant assume to have truth if not dealing with truth (GOD`S LIVING WORD - THE BIBLE) and only being busy satans lies (quran). \r\nYou can`t take your money with you when you die, all that go is just you, naked in your sins, or covered in white, as you were washed clean by the blood of CHRIST - your redeemer. \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbVDSs967Yo\r\n\r\nBible Verses About Early Death\r\nBible verses related to\u00a0Early Death\u00a0from the King James Version (KJV) by Relevance\r\n\u00a0\r\n-\u00a0Sort By Book Order\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIsaiah 57:1-2\u00a0-\u00a0The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart: and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(Read More...)\n\nEcclesiastes 7:17\u00a0-\u00a0Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?\n\nJames 1:12\u00a0-\u00a0Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.\n\nJohn 3:16\u00a0-\u00a0For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\n\nLuke 23:43\u00a0-\u00a0And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.\n\n1 Timothy 4:1-16\u00a0-\u00a0Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(Read More...)\n\nMatthew 6:27\u00a0-\u00a0Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?\n\nHebrews 2:9\u00a0-\u00a0But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.\n\n1 Thessalonians 5:16-18\u00a0-\u00a0Rejoice evermore.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(Read More...)\n\n1 John 5:16-17\u00a0-\u00a0If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(Read More...)\n\nPsalms 139:16\u00a0-\u00a0Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.\n\nRomans 8:31-34\u00a0-\u00a0What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(Read More...)\r\n\r\n\r\nSeems that you are a soul, who haven\u00b4t read nor studied the bible, search about freemasonry - therefore still living without the KNODLEGDE and for that: Hosea 4:6 | View whole chapter | See verse in context My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children. \"seems like some people just genuinely don't want anything other than a simple life and to be told what to do.\" - these souls are known as LUKEWARMS and willingly ignorant. In other words: let the evilness runs ramped - as long as i am not douched by it - it`s all fine. If we (and as long as we) have a blind eyes and ears towards pure evil (are the bystanders) - then we live with NO RIGHT to complain. For life then is already good, cause all we see and hear is all we like to see and hear, these things that we don`t like,towards all of that , we turn an blind eyes and deaf ears. It`s heartbreakingly sad, that many amongst us just DOSEN`T CARE. Ans for that they all: Matthew 7:13 | View whole chapter | See verse in context Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: Because of JUST NOT CEARING - JUST NOT BELIEVING - JUST NOT SEEING NOR EARING THEREFORE NO KNOWLEDGE TO AGREE OR DISAGREE - just because of that and their own sins too - they all end up twice DEAD. For the LAKE OF FIRE - WHERE MANY GO - IS THE 2ND DEATH: Revelation 20:15 | View whole chapter | See verse in context And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire. Revelation 20:14 | View whole chapter | See verse in context And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. \r\n\r\n\r\nIf you only know - understand and search - then you`ll see also - how many are transgenders in this world. The number of biological males and females went down quickly. And that not only in one country nor in one century - but many years and all around the world. The only thing that changed: it became public and now it`s \"cool\" just because it is presented so. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe clock it ticking and time pass by fast, therefore I pray: GOD, free those who still in bondage, open their eyes and ears, who still don\u00b4t see nor hear \u2013 so that they alos could notice the truth and accept it. May less and less the number of the souls, who`m you have placed under the strong delusion: 2 Thessalonians 2:11\u00a0|\u00a0View whole chapter\u00a0|\u00a0See verse in context\r\nAnd for this cause God shall send them\u00a0strong\u00a0delusion, that they should believe a lie:\ndecrease. May souls get saved. Amen.\r\n\r\nNo job, girlfriend or friends.? --- Dear soul, it`s time for GOD. Seek Him and call upon His name =get saved, Heavenly everlasting home awaits. You must get saved and drop your sins or the heavenly gates won\u00b4t open up. ( you can`t be a unholy being in holy place).",

Hope and peace it sends to you, the sky aren\u00b4t grey, they turn to blue. And when you wake up, the world has changed and all your pains are rearranged. So live your life, enjoy it well don\u00b4t think about going to hell. Relish every moment and every hour, and it will grow and stay like a flower. We just live it one time and never twice, listen to yourself and look at the sunrise. Hatuk Hill",

Especially if the ground \n\nhas shifted and it is no longer straight up attached \n\nto the floor. That way so that as you go to change clear \n\nou the vents all the critters that were probably kept away\u2028\nfrom the what was once clogged vents dont just come running\n\nin. When you fix a problem left side must equal right side b4 you \n\nmake a move. You need to have closure adn grow through the \n\nexperiences. Set you systems. With Good bones. Hozier Marren \u2028\u2028Morris Song Inspo. And then life lessons. That you send back send \n\nout to people. And then a whole new power of habit for the new system.\n\nThe fixed system. Cause before you had the broken system and that is \n\nwhere the muscle memory will// may go. Also remember why you left?\u2028\nAnd or why you didnt want to do it before hand and account for those?\u2028\u2028New jobs will be created then. Whether that was spread to thin. Needed \u2028\ntime to recharge. Safely. Not just physically but emotionally. \n\n\n\n\n\nThat what Libra \u2028\u2028system is. Clearing the Vents system but youve got to account for that. \u2028\u2028Emotional Wealth counted like when working in retail. Hourly, daily, weekly,\n\nmonthly, quarterly, but now the second quarter will have two functions the \n\n2nd Quarter and as well as the semi annual sale. Thats why everyone is running \n\na business, working from home, and doing make up and having morning routines. \u2028\u2028Were preparing for the morning rush. You have to get used to learning about your \u2028\u2028home and running it like a business because we have been home so much. The Lady\u2028\u2028of Proverbs. A House Wife. \u201cRun it like a business\u201d \u2014 Jay Z. Jigga keeps ish popping. \u2028\u2028It took a while for me to get there though. Okay SO Second Quarter and as well as semi \n\nannual will need like equality and equity. And when people end shift like at cash. You \n\nbalance out there till before they leave. Hence sometimes most times people leave in \n\nbatches. Like batch content. Like the Tiktok trends posted on Youtube. Because you dont wanna call at store closing for questions and or concerns about a till closing at mid day. And so when if people are coming in and or out of your life during pandemic you may wanna do some emotional closure. Even if it is quick short and sweet. What did you learn. Your good to go thank you. So that way it is not too much of a culture shock going\nforward into the new world. I mean if you are making some lifestyle changes. It\u2019d be great to jot somethings down. So that in the event of a possible mud slide you have deep \nroots and won\u2019t possibly fall down. Mud slide too much sweetness. Umm there is a things where Most Times trees with deep roots tend to survive in the event of a mud slide. Although if you can prevent the mud slide all together, \u201cprevent is better then cure\u201d \u2014 My Gma. But you are trying to live in this life not prevent it and nor run into all on coming danger. And so more places should just regularly have seasonal employment. Like if retail is hiring more people then that is a lot of contracts, whoever does the law for those business should have more seasonal hires hired ahead of time. That is why some people dont always make it home for Christmas because they are out working late because the work piles up. So head office and Corporate should have seasonal hires. Its great for turn over. Flushing in new air. Also gives university students, paralegals a step in the door. Low Risk Low reward. They get to see if they like it before doing all the work to graduate. Before fully committing to a employment career path after they have acquired all the school debt. And or done all the work. Only to realize that they hate the career and or hate the way that it is done. Set up to fail and or \u201cBuilt to fall apart\u201d \u2014 Taylor Swift Out of the woods song inspo. You know how all thin people are liek sheep hearded towards Modeling like we dont really make room for them within society; yet. Like if you were tall and thin where can you get your clothes?!?! Liek for real? Like Im like 5,4. And the clothes the pants just touch my ankles. If not fully cover them. How are tall people just shopping on the regs. Like it must be really hard. And thats not even tall and curvy; yet. Liek School can be an Emotional Everest. And its liek some places know that. And make a business where you have to pass through the invitation process surpassing the Emotional Everest sometimes at the expense of your Mental Health. And then run a business where you dont yet get to sample, and that sometimes they know they dont liek but liek sell it to you at full charge. And then youre stuck with the bill. Like if you need the degreee to get the job but then you need the job to continue to fund the education. By the time you graduate if you didnt sell yourself or were funding by someone else, sometimes parents other times not. Then you need the job to pay off the debt and its not even if you fully like it or not. Its relying on burnt out love for affection. Like youre telling me that there is no entry level data entry jobs, that go around just more seasonally. Proofreading for parallels adn or English Lit students. Like why are University students coming back to Retail when there should be head office and or Corporate jobs that should be hiring seasonal. And then the workers are possibly overworked and or burnt out and or needing to pay for an expensive house.

Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord.\n1 Thessalonians 4:16,17. Have you heard about the return of Jesus Christ and are you also prepared for this event that will mark the final moment of history? All the prophecies described by Jesus in his ministry are being fulfilled as great signs in the heavens, famines, wars, pestilences and earthquakes everywhere, which indicate that his coming is already near. The Rapture of the Church of Jesus (every saved person, whether Jew or Gentile, will be taken from the earth) will bring a sudden, dramatic, and unimaginable blow to the history of humanity left behind. This revolutionary event will trigger a series of other subsequent events.\nLike the appearance of Antichrist and the 7 years of great Tribulation on Earth. And even if we do not reach the day of his return, we must be prepared so that if we die, we will be sure to be resurrected on that day. For that, we have to accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Only and Sufficient Savior of our lives, and so we have an encounter with him and obtain the salvation of our soul. So make your choice, accept Jesus right now, ask forgiveness for your sins and be sure of eternal life.\nI call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse; therefore choose life, that you and your descendants may live.\nDeuteronomy 30:19 R.M\n\nWOULD YOU LIKE TO ACCEPT JESUS \u200b\u200bAS YOUR PERSONAL SAVIOR ?",
