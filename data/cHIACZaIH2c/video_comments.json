I really just shake my ass to them. And there are so many new girls out there who have better cadence and lyricism. It's not that my body doesn't enjoy the music but my mind isn't in it. And people calling her the Princess of Rap is terrible. So, I'm sure Ice is one of the women she was talking about. If Ice had better lyricism, cadence, and actually danced or moved on stage instead of just showing her ass, she would be good \ud83d\ude01",
