But as I've been home for a few months I rediscovered this song, It still brings back memories from the mental hospital, but without the context of being in the mental hospital I've started to really enjoy it, its even one of my favoritve songs right now. Things change, Just because you have on bad experience with something doesn't mean it will be bad forever, that doesn't mean you have to enjoy it in the future, but things do change, jus try to remember that :)",

It's great for when you're feeling up, but it doesn't really have anything to say. The Weeknd's music, on the other hand, is dark and mysterious. It's about love, loss, and pain. It's real.\n\nI think that's why The Weeknd is so much better than Harry Styles. He's not afraid to go to the dark places. He's not afraid to be real. And that's what makes his music so powerful",

Those children sure loved Harry while he was dating their mom, and Harry got attached to the children as well. Then came the break-up, and Harry stopped coming around. The children miss Harry terribly and don't understand why they can't see him anymore. And Harry misses the children like a good father would (although he is not their real father). This song is about how a breakup has affected Harry and his ex's children. It's a sad song. The beginning of the song has children asking why Harry can't play. Harry puts his hand out but a closed door is blocking the way, signifying the relationship is not the same \"as it was.\"",

I cant even remember  the last time I wanted to buy anyone else's music, because it is so long ago. I hope you have a really dull wishy washy lifetime, you deserve it. But remember this, you will never be able to play like me. None of you get even close to doing what I can do. As for this waste of space? Away and boil her head. One direction and that's the oxfam shelves in a few years. Yer kidding yourselves on. You're all just kidding yourselves on aren't you. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/pMthmew5ISM",
