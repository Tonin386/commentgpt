I heard it and then I thought it would be my favorite song and I was sad when the Grande died. Then I was a bit happy because he didn't actually die and it's good acting. I love it and I really want a shout out.  So please, I've never had a shout out and I've never had one so I think it's real cool.\nCause I think it's real cool.\nI love it, thank you, bye.\ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude13\ud83d\ude2d",

I was never into his music but since his music was SOOO consistent and changed up so many times. He matured and all that stuff and went crazy and back and all of it and you grow up with this songs just playing at all times. He's like part of my childhood is what im saying. LOL. Like the fact that it has been awhile since the biebs came out with a top track worries me. I feel like i'll always expect him to have something amazing for his fans at least once a year. like it'll never stop. I hope he continues to make music for 30+ more years. Go biebs lol he's honestly just a beast of a human if you all think about it. Like how many times have his songs been played? 40+ billion times? Lol 100+ billion?

Now I regret not telling him that I'm sorry, love him and I already forgive him for what he has done to us (my siblings). It really broke my heart when i saw him before he was cremated. He looks like he's in pain and asking for help but there's no one to help him \ud83d\ude1e I'm so stupid not talking to him and allowing my pride to take over. Now this song hits really harder and it's painful at the same time. I wish he now found the true happiness he's looking for on where he's at now because I know he did'nt find it here.\n\nTell your parents you love them or forgive them while they're still here because we'll never know when it's too late. Even when you cry your heart out they can't hear you. Trust me, learned it the hard way.",

Each day feels incomplete without your presence, and I miss you endlessly.\n\nYour giving spirit and boundless love touched all who knew you. You've left a void that can never be filled, and your absence is felt deeply. As I navigate daily, your lessons and love remain my guiding light.\n\nRest in peace, Dad. Your memory lives on in every cherished moment, and your legacy of selflessness will forever inspire me. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udc99",
