I just want to share the good news of salvation.\n\nEven if You feel that You are alone and no one cares for you, Someone cares and loves You unconditionally. His name is the LORD GOD who created you and me\u2014who knows everything about us, every pain, every failure, every struggle and every hurt in us. He is there and He wants to be a Father to you. However, the reality is GOD is perfect and He is holy but we are sinners for we sinned against Him and against others. As GOD is a God of justice, He is against sin and so we cannot save ourselves by our own power because of our fallen nature. Nevertheless, as GOD loves us so much and desires to reconcile us to Himself, He descended from Heaven and took the form of man. He is the Lord JESUS who lived His life without sin because He himself is GOD. Him being the perfect sacrificial lamb, He was crucified to take on the punishment that was meant for us sinners. He died for You and me. But death cannot hold the Lord JESUS because He doesn't deserve death for He did not sin and so now reigns in heaven. By accepting the Lord JESUS as your personal Lord and Savior, you receive His sacrifice and so your sins will be forgiven by the LORD. The Lord JESUS loves you and if You come to Him regardless of Your past, He can renew you. He is able to wash our sins clean by His precious blood. You can come to Him. \n\nFor GOD so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life.\nJohn 3:16",
