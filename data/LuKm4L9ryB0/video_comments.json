These rappers don't even care anymore just name the car you were driving and what gun you used. If i can figure this shit out you think the YouTube Feds cant? Oh and Marilyn Manson and Uzi and Travis and Carti drawing inspiration is just weak, it reminds me of all the socal trust fund babies spending $4,400 on a $20 @Nirvana Incesticide shirt, but it you were to ask what their favorite song off bleach is, i bet they couldn't answer. 30 anniversary edition, or just a normal Friday Kurt Cobain woild not let one of his Incesticde shirts be sold by a weirdo designer flor almost $4,500 USD. You could buy 3 of Kurts designed JagStang guitsrs new for that price fuck YSL",

Its kinda like the fact that ll cool j beat canibus. It wasn't that ll had a great diss record, it's just that ll had that God status at that moment in time. Nothing canibus could have said would have overcome that fact. Drake should have thought about that during his pusha t battle he might have had the appropriate approach then",
