People will love only themselves and their money. They will be boastful and proud, scoffing at God, disobedient to their parents, and ungrateful. They will consider nothing sacred. They will be unloving and unforgiving; they will slander others and have no self-control. They will be cruel and hate what is good. They will betray their friends, be reckless, be puffed up with pride, and love pleasure rather than God. They will act religious, but they will reject the power that could make them godly. Stay away from people like that!\" Jesus is coming back. Are you ready?",

I am not very good at figuring out what a lot of music videos represent, so it makes me happy that I actually figured one out.  I think parts of the scenery being turned upside down or made to look like walls and Ariana walking on the side of a skyscraper represented her taking on a new perspective in life.  Now that she is no longer crying, she is able to see the positives.",

Whoever does not take up his cross,\u271d and follow after me, is not worthy of me.\ud83d\ude2e\ud83d\udca8\ud83d\ude13 Whoever finds his life will lose it; and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. Jesus is speaking in this word that those who prefer the things of the world, sin, entertainment and reject him, are not worthy of him. Taking up the cross and following Jesus means crucifying oneself to worldly things. People on the contrary are wanting to find their lives in this world, they don't want to lose their lives to follow it, they don't want to lose fun, sinful pleasures, lust, fame, etc., etc. Many think they can live a little longer, when they are old, they accept Jesus. We move to the other side when we least expect it, we often don't have time to do that. You will be lost and in torment afterwards.\ud83e\udd2e\ud83d\ude29\ud83e\udd2e Don't delay, he calls you.
