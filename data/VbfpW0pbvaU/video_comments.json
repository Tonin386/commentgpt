        "text": "The most barbaric disease that affects 220,000,000 females that could be described as drop dead gorgeous super beautiful heroines that save the world called Endometriosis has no cure. It just has barbaric treatments which are useful in only 25% of Endo warriors causing pain that has been described as being like giving birth 4 to 5 times weekly for an Endo warriors entire high school,college and working lives when it could have been removed early in life when it is entirely in the reproductive system before it spreads throughout the body to places no surgical equipment, medicines nor any Endo specialist can get to, constantly reqrowing.\r\n\r\nWhere by the time an Endo warrior enters menopause when estrogen stop fertilizes Endo, almost all have had at least 10 to up to 20 either excision (removal) or ablation (burning off the top) surgeries at a cost per failed attempt of $10,000 with insurance for those fortunate to cover to $50,000 without it costing each Endo warrior up to an accumulated 3 years off work for recoveries and an additional two years in lost time at work, leading to a near impossibility of ever achieving 1,250 fmla hours and almost always getting fired asking for ADA which simply isn\u2019t accomodatable and an average of 25 to 30 jobs.\r\n\r\nI am calling on a national movement to create a simple 15 minute naval injection of a fluid that would reach to every organ surface and even penetrate organs to kill ademyosis and leave a lifetime protective coating at a cost of less than $100 and the same recovery time to resume daily activities (mostly work) as quickly as covid vaccines that were invented for several variants at no cost and distributed to virtually the entire world in months.\r\n\r\nThe same intensity given to covid that individuals could have prevented should be equaled to Endo warriors who got the horror by being born female and with abnormal levels of estrogen that fertilizes the endo to them.That while blesses the world with overpowering beauty, prettiness, radiance , picturesque professionalism, overwhelming intelligence, talent, skills,dedication all used for unfathomable morality,ethics, wholesomeness and virtue and seemingly every positive external and internal characteristic.\r\n\r\nIt takes about 12 years brushed off by doctors who know nothing about Endometriosis getting false diagnoisis\u2019 and needless tests. Starting with the first complaint to parents and teachers in middle school or even elementary school about pelvic pains, especially inserting tampons, excessive painful urination and defecation, abnormal amounts of period length and discharge. Where uneducated parents and teachers view their young girls and just being hysterical, trying to get attention or wondering, what are they trying to jet out of this month like she does every month. Leading to discipline and yelling at, instead of finding out what is wrong with her and getting her an ultra sound to detect ovarian cysts which are the primary indicator of Endometriosis. For which if detected and treated in the first few years of periods can be successfully removed with excision surgery in its entirety when only in the reproductive system resulting in a normal pain free life with but a child hood trauma and not by the time when they are even 15 when it has spread so much that no surgical equipment nor any Endo specialist can get to, leading to a high school, college, working life until menopause of excruciating daily pain that almost all Endo mothers claim is worse than child birth. By the time an Endo warrior begins college the pain that was once only a stomach pain where the all the endo was, has grown everywhere cementing itself on every organ along with whole body pain. Each so called \u201cGold Standard\u201d results in less pain relief, longer recovery times and thus more time without pay.\r\n\r\nWith good parents and teachers who won\u2019t just tell their crying students to just get back to class and stop faking it, which is what virtually all that is done in schools, who observe the obvious that a young girl is a fantastic student and person, ready for school and maybe a job an hour before needed with a life full of extra circular activities Yet ever three weeks or so for about a week she is still in bed at 7:10 has to painfully urinate seemingly all the time and torture like removing and inserting tampons and a bladder so filled she can\u2019t make it to the end of class without bleeding  through clothes. A young girl won\u2019t suffer. If the parents do medical research instead of discipline for being hysterical to find the reason for their daughter\u2019s suffering , she would never endured in the first place.\r\n\r\nWhen estrogen production ends , the scar tissue from the burning off of ablation surgery or the digging into tissue over and over for almost all leads to pain for life. The Trojan horse promoted by doctors being hysterectomies or birth control only eliminates endo reqrowth in 15% to 20% percent of those barbarically conned like was done in the horribly inaccurate scenes in Grey\u2019s Anatomy season 18 episode 10 where a endo warrior just goes into Grey Sloan the doctors immediately assume Endo and that afternoon do a lap and prescribe birth control and pain meds-all in a single visit. Where for every single Endo warrior the cruel voyage to a lap is at least 12 years of barbaric women\u2019s medical gaslighting.\r\n\r\nAnd as Endo Warrior Victoria Williams and my inspiration claims, once a woman comes forward seeking ADA at work, they are instead given less hours, less responsibility and thus less pay leading to what Meghhin cries out in her video,,,\u201dI only have so much money and I spend it all on doctors that aren\u2019t helping.\u201d Or her best line to her doctor \u201cI am paying you thousands and thousands of dollars and you can\u2019t even tell me I have Endo and not just Allen Masters Syndrome. I pay them thousands of dollars and they have one job and they say they don\u2019t want to risk looking at al the places, but someone who is a specialist should have the skill and expertise to go to difficult places.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd while non Endo people have runs, dog walks and workouts before a long day of pleasurable work then going out with friends to some fun place,an Endo warrior with no dog or cat because they can\u2019t afford the deposit or risk unpayable vet bills, starts the day with a hot cbd bubble bath, then loading up on prescription pain pills and the con job birth control pills which just screw up hormones, just to make it to lunch where they take more pain pills and heating pads and just hope to make it home safe and not have to stop in an ER or rest in someone\u2019s driveway to make it home to get their medical marijuana to help them survive another day having already used up most of their sick days for the week, terrified how many pills it will take tomorrow, desperately struggling for days off to sleep and cry while their coworkers are hiking, going on weekend trips, reading and watching Hallmark movies while Endo warriors read and watch medical journals about how the hysterectomy one of the dozens of gaslighting doctors told her would be a cure.\r\n\r\nAnd the hardships of painful sex or any type of pelvic contact ruins most male relationships that result in many break ups a year as soon as sex is desired, leading them to seek the unconditional love of cats (my most inspirational Endo cats, Jinx, Belle and Bo and dogs(a yorkie called Cooper).\r\n\r\nEndo is so common yet only 20% of primary care physicians know even one symptom and there are but 100 excision specialists in the country and only 200 in the world due to the extra years of training it takes without getting paid instead of providing other people medical care. For if there was a cure as simple as covid, Endo warriors could have Hope For The Future\u2026that\r\n\r\nWE\u2019LL FIND TOMORROW..\r\nSTEVE BAYT PARMA,Ohio\r\n\r\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLCeQyxVWB8&t=690s",

        "text": "Dear Reader, When I first began to form the idea of torpedo ink, I knew it was going to be a very gritty and raw series, certainly not for everyone. In fact, at first, although I had to write the stories because I felt it was necessary, I doubted if I would ever publish them. I had learned over the years that males, when molested, were often not given the same treatment as female victims. Often families were too ashamed to have the child go into counseling. They didn\u00b4t want friends and family to know what happened. Sometimes the familiy members would even applaud the boy if the offender was a female and tell him how lucky he was. Over times, the males in the family would shun the boy or even want him send away if he was molested or raped by a male. To me, it was a tragic situation. i hope that over time, these responses have changed a little, but I don\u00b4t think they have by that much. Why a motorcycle club? First, most motorcycle clubs are not running around the nation committing crimes. Often, they are men and women getting together because they like the freedom of riding. Many clubs stand for victims like the children I portray in my novels. Usually the perception of those riding motorcycles is that they are tough. I wanted men and women my readers was as tough. They survived abuse and understandably have PTSD and issues with sex due to their backgrounds. I needed readers to understand and be sympathic toward my heroes and heroines. Nevertheless, even by portraying them as close to reality in these conditions as possible, these are still works of fiction. I have tried to handle these situations with understanding and compassion and without judgement. I read as much as possible on each issue and then consult with primary sources before I feel able to write on the subject without prejudice or judgement. I don\u00b4t ever want to depict one moment were a character is in an abusive situation and has no choice. The books are intensive and some of the situations can be abusive, especially in savage\u00b4s books, as he is a sexual sadist. I want any reader to be clear on that fact before choosing to read this book. Savages first book, Annihilatioin road, stopped prior to seychelle\u00b4s training. That was a deliberate choice I made so that readers demanding his book, knowing what he was but also knowing they would hae difficulties, would still have a satisfactory, happy ending to his story. Savage road is much more difficult to read and much truer to life ,after the beginning of the love story between two people who truly love each other and have made a commitment but come from very different worlds. Savages world could easily be one of abuse. There is a very important moment where Savage makes certain the heroine knows she can speak with her friends and receive support about thei relationshipf if she needs to. Again, it is important to me when writing a book to research the subject matter heavily so I can write without prejudice. there are many different lifestyles and needs, and not all people are alike or have similar pasts. People are shaped in many different ways by their exeriences. Seychelle entered consensually into savages world because she needed the same things he did, which made them the perfect couple. She entered the relationship knowing what he was and wanting to share this lifestyle with the man she loves and trusts wholeheartedly with her body, mind and heart. For the readers who have decided to continue the ride with seychelle and savage, I hope you feel that I\u00b4ve done their story justice. Christine Feehan",

        "text": "Doc is currently a character in the Disney theme parks, mostly for parades and promotional material as opposed to meet-and-greets. Doc wears a yellow outfit with an orange cap, matching shoes, and blue pants. \n\nIn Snow White's Scary Adventures, Doc appears as an audio-animatronic and is seen playing \"The Silly Song\", chasing after the Queen, and later saying goodbye to Snow White and the Prince.\n\nA statue of Doc and the other dwarfs can be seen alongside the forest display in Snow White's Grotto.\n\nIn the 2015 rendition of World of Color, Doc appeared during the segment celebrating the significance of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. \n\nAn animatronic Doc is featured working in the mines alongside the other dwarfs in Seven Dwarfs Mine Train. He can be seen in the mine, bellowing his famous \"Heigh-ho\", again in the form of a silhouette, and lastly, dancing alongside Snow White during the final scene.\n\nDoc also makes a cameo appearance during the bubble montage in Disney's Hollywood Studios' version of Fantasmic!.\n\nDoc and the other dwarfs make a live appearance in the Festival of Fantasy parade. \n\nFor regular meet-and-greets, Doc can be found in Fantasyland of Tokyo Disneyland. \n\nDoc appears alongside Snow White and the other dwarfs in Golden Fairytale Fanfare, as well as the opening unit of Mickey's Storybook Express. \n\n    During the Second World War, a radar training squadron, known as the Snow White squadron, named their Boeing B-29 bombers after the characters from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. One of them was named after Doc, which is the second flyable B-29 alongside FIFI.\n    Doc is the only dwarf of the group whose name is not an adjective. He is also the only dwarf who wears glasses.\n\n    Kingdom Hearts Wikia Favicon Doc on Kingdom Hearts Wiki",

        "text": "In the animated series, Doc, like the classic character, serves as the apparent leader of the dwarfs and acts as the brains of the group. Here, Doc is an impressive inventor, capable of creating contraptions varying from giant machines to a customized hat with various useful abilities. His intelligence also makes him the biggest threat to the show's villains, Grim and Hildy Gloom.\n\nUnlike the movie version, however, the 7D version of Doc doesn't constantly stumble on his words and speaks just fine. His rivalry with Grumpy is also nonexistent in this incarnation, mostly due to the fact that Happy's excessively joyous attitude is what annoys Grumpy the most. \n\nDoc made an appearance in the episode \"Wish Upon a Coin\". He and the other dwarfs are first seen depositing coins into a wishing well, which are soon stolen by Pete, causing Doc and the other dwarfs to fall into panic. Mickey Mouse heads after Pete and manages to retrieve the coins, settling Doc and the other dwarfs and fulfilling their wishes (which is revealed to be a wish to have a head of hair). During a brief scene, Doc was used by Mickey when the latter gave suggestions on what to do following the coin theft, including tripping over a dwarf and sitting on a dwarf. \n\nDoc appeared in the 1941 wartime short, Seven Wise Dwarfs, in which he and the other dwarfs invest the proceeds of their diamond mine into Canadian War Bonds.\n\nIn Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Doc is seen in Toontown with many other cartoon characters and Disney characters. Like most of the cameos in the film, Doc plays a very minor, non-speaking role.\n\nDoc makes a brief cameo in Flubber, appearing on Weebo the Robot's video monitor, which showcased a scene from the film. \n\nDoc makes various non-speaking cameos in the animated series House of Mouse. In \"Not So Goofy\", Doc ordered a meal with no cholesterol. In \"Pluto Saves the Day\", Pete tries to convince Goofy to eat a poisoned apple by saying \"An apple a day keeps the doc away\", to which Goofy replies \"But I like Doc!\" while hugging Doc himself. He was also seen in Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse.\n\nIn the Teacher's Pet movie, Doc and the other dwarfs briefly appear in the song \"Ivan Krank\"; when Dr. Ivan Krank says \"he stands on the shoulders of giants,\" he is standing on the seven dwarfs.\n\nDoc appears in the final scene of The Lion King 1\u00bd, where he, the other dwarves, and Snow White join Timon, Pumbaa, and a crew of other Disney characters to watch the encore of the film. \n\nDoc is a member of the War Council and Personal Physician to Snow White who becomes a Doctor at Storybrooke Hospital. He helps Snow White give birth to Emma. When Greg Mendell literally crashes into Storybrooke, Leroy says Doc is not skilled enough to perform surgery. He is played by David Avalon. \n\nDoc appears along with the other Dwarfs in the series, where their first appearance was in a glass podium with Snow White during the first game's Dive to the Heart. Unlike the Beast's servants, they are depicted as awake, meaning either their homeworld was not devoured by the Heartless, or that the Dwarfs were able to get to safety beforehand. Prior to the events of Kingdom Hearts, the Dwarfs' appearances in Birth by Sleep reveals their lives working in the mines for jewels until the arrival of the Keyblade wielders in their world. The Dwarfs encounter the first of these warriors, Ventus, and all show hostility towards the newcomer, with the exception of Dopey. After returning to their cottage, the dwarfs meet Snow White for the first time and take her in after she claimed she was attacked by an Unversed. Unfortunately, Snow White falls into a deep slumber after taking a bite from the Queen's poisoned apple and the Dwarfs place her in a glass coffin to mourn her. Doc fills Aqua in on the situation and thanks to assistance from the latter and the Prince, Snow White is able to awaken, and the Dwarfs celebrate.\n\nDoc also appears in Kingdom Hearts \u03c7 along with the others in Dwarf Woodlands. \n\nDoc is a supporting character in Snow White's world. He meets the player after they've been introduced to a problem at hand, being the dwarfs' lack of cooperation as they worked in the mines. With Doc's guidance, however, things are able to move back into form eventually, but when a new problem arises Doc informs the heroine, that problem being the missing color throughout the forest, as well as the stolen color of the rainbow. The dwarfs are able to help guide the heroine throughout the forest to retrieve and return all the missing colors, bringing back peace yet again before her departure.",

        "text": "Doc is first introduced, with his six companions, at the Dwarfs' Mine. His job is to sort the diamonds that Grumpy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Happy have unearthed which Sleepy brings to him. The diamonds that make a ringing sound and are in good shape are valuable and are placed in the bags with the other good diamonds, while the ones that make a clunking sound or are broken are worthless and are tossed aside to be swept up by Dopey. At one point, while seeing Doc study a diamond with a magnifier, Dopey puts two diamonds on his eyes (making it look like he had 18 of them), causing Doc to knock them off Dopey in disapproval. Just seconds after that, the alarm on a clock, which reminded the dwarfs that work was over, went off. Doc is the first to hear the alarm and alerts the other dwarfs that it is time for them to go home and he and Dopey put the diamonds he put on the sacks on the vault and Dopey locks it. He leads the dwarfs as they sing \"Heigh-Ho\".\n\nWhen the seven dwarfs reach their cottage, Doc suddenly stops (causing the six other dwarfs to pile up behind him), noticing that light is coming from the house. The dwarfs think that a monster has taken up residence in their house. They sneak into the cottage; Doc, holding a candle, tells them to search everywhere.\n\nAt one point, Sleepy steps on a creaky floorboard, flustering Doc. The dwarfs note that the cottage has been cleaned. They decide that whatever is in the cottage is upstairs, and Doc declares that one of them must go upstairs to chase it out of the house. Dopey is elected, and Doc, his hand shaking, gives Dopey the candle. Dopey is so terrified upon entering the bedroom that, when he hears a noise coming from the beds, he screams and rushes out of the bedroom knocking the other dwarfs downstairs. The dwarfs decide that they must get rid of this beast once and for all, and enter the bedroom, once again led by Doc. They are about to strike whatever is sleeping in their beds when they realize that it is the princess, Snow White. Grumpy begins to complain, and Doc attempts to silence him, but Snow White is woken up. She manages to match the name at the foot of each bed to the correct dwarf, identifying Doc first.\n\nDoc attempts to express his delight, but is flustered, and gets into an argument with Grumpy, who wants Snow White to leave. Eventually, it is agreed that Snow White will clean and cook for the dwarfs if she is allowed to stay. She prepares soup for them but demands that they wash first. Doc attempts to say that they have recently washed, but, after examining each dwarf's hands, the princess sends them outside to a trough. Here, the dwarfs, led by Doc, wash while singing \"Bluddle-Uddle-Um-Dum (The Dwarfs' Washing Song)\". When Sneezy dips his finger in the water, he blubbers shocking Doc and the other dwarfs except for Grumpy.\n\nGrumpy refuses to wash, which leads Doc to hatch a sneaky plan and have him and the other dwarfs force Grumpy into the tub. Along the way, Doc gets frustrated at Dopey's clumsiness, ordering him to get more soap. This inadvertently leads to Dopey swallowing it after it slips out his hands and bounces off Doc's rear, landing in Dopey's stomach. Doc is left unaware of Dopey's predicament as he leads the other dwarfs in dragging Grumpy to the water and washing him thoroughly.\n\nLater that evening, after supper, the seven dwarfs entertain Snow White with \"The Silly Song\", while Doc plays a stringed instrument shaped like a duck, in addition to dancing alongside Snow White. After they finish the song, the dwarfs listen to Snow White sing \"Some Day My Prince Will Come\", which sends every dwarf, except the stubborn Grumpy, into a dream-like state. Doc declares that Snow White will sleep in the bedroom upstairs, and the dwarves must sleep downstairs. Doc sleeps in the sink.\n\nThe next morning, Doc is the first to leave and is seen off by Snow White, whom he warns to be wary of strangers. While the dwarfs head to the mine, the Queen, as the Witch, makes her way to the cottage, knowing that only Snow White will be at home. Upon her arrival at the cottage, the animals sense danger and, after attempting to drive her away, rush to the mine to fetch the dwarfs. When they discover that the Queen has found Snow White, the dwarfs rush home to find that the Witch has succeeded in poisoning the princess and is about to leave. The dwarfs chase the Witch into the mountains, and she reaches a cliff. She attempts to crush the dwarfs with a boulder, but a flash of lightning causes her to fall from the cliff and be crushed by the boulder herself.\n\nThe seven dwarfs mourn Snow White's death; Doc is shown crying silently and attempting to comfort Dopey, who is sobbing on his shoulder. The dwarfs find her to be so beautiful, even in death, that they fashion a coffin from glass and place her inside. The Prince arrives, and the dwarfs part so that he can approach Snow White. He kisses her, breaking the spell of the Sleeping Death, with Doc being the third Dwarf to notice her awakening. The dwarfs cheer, with Doc and Grumpy hugging each other in happiness. Before Snow White leaves with the Prince, she kisses each dwarf on the forehead (Doc was third). \n\nIn 1943 educational short, Doc and the dwarfs are enlisted in helping rid their forest and cottage home of deadly mosquitoes that can spread the harmful disease malaria. Throughout the animated short, the dwarfs give examples of the precautions necessary to keep people safe from the spreading crises and ensure safety.\n\nWhilst all of the other dwarfs were featured working alone in certain areas, Doc was notably seen leading the group, working alongside others such as Bashful, Sleepy, and Sneezy.",

        "text": "This article is about the Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs character. For other topics named Doc, see Doc (disambiguation).\n\n    \u201cThis pompous-looking individual is Doc\u2014the self-appointed leader of the group.\u201d\n    \u2015Walt Disney introducing Doc\n\nDoc is the leader of the seven dwarfs in Disney's 1937 animated film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Though he may seem befuddled due to his dithering speech pattern, Doc is an intelligent and reliable figurehead to whom the other dwarfs look for guidance. \n\nPerce Pierce, one of the storymen working on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, was particularly active in creating the characters of the dwarfs.\n\nDoc was not present in the original November 1935 story outline of the film Robert D. Field, \"The Art of Walt Disney\". Several months later, his role in the film and his relationship with Grumpy was established: Walt Disney commented that Doc's flustered personality should be such that he never knew quite where he is without one of his fellow dwarfs reminding him. Disney personally suggested the sequence in which Grumpy feeds him the phrase \"mad as hornets\" when Doc is lost for words, causing Doc to blurt out Grumpy's words without thinking, and having to go back and correct himself, leading to even more dithering.\n\nRadio comedian Roy Atwell, who used stammering in his act and specialized in mixed-up language, was appropriately chosen for the voice of Doc.\n\nThough designing the dwarfs was relatively easy, animating them proved to be difficult, as the animators, already finding human figures difficult to animate, now had to animate 'ill-formed' human figures. Vladimir Tytla noted that the dwarfs should walk with a swing to their hips, and Fred Moore commented that the dwarfs had to move a little more quickly to keep up with the human characters. In order to establish Doc's character during the march home in \"Heigh Ho\", George Stalling noted traits specific to the character, to be taken into account in the animation: An armature of each dwarf was constructed as reference for the animators. Les Clark was responsible for the animation of Snow White dancing with Doc and Happy. Clark found this task difficult but reputedly accepted and completed it without argument. Snow White's movements and a decrease in size as she moved further from the camera were dictated by the filmed footage of Marge Champion, though Doc and Happy were drawn without the aid of live-action reference. \n\nA sequence that was fully animated was ultimately cut as it was felt to detract from the story. Following Snow White's promise that she will cook gooseberry pie, all dwarfs cheer and agree that she can stay. The deleted sequence begins when Grumpy disagrees and scolds his fellows for weakening at the mention of gooseberry pie. Doc confronts Grumpy and demands that he let Snow White stay, but Grumpy continues to refuse. The two dwarfs walk up to each other, eventually hurting themselves by squashing their bulbous noses against each other. As they back away from each other again, Grumpy insults Doc, who, flustered, tried to repeat the phrase but gets it wrong at every attempt. Grumpy, fed up, twists Docs nose; Doc retorts by knocking Grumpy's nose, causing it to swing from side to side. A fight ensues, which Grumpy appears to be winning until the other dwarfs try to pry him away. Snow White reminds them of how scary the forest will be for her if she has to leave, and Grumpy finally agrees that she can stay until she has made the gooseberry pie. The entire sequence can be seen on the second disc of the Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs Platinum Edition DVD.\n\nA scene was storyboarded and partly animated in which the dwarfs hold a meeting to decide on a gift for Snow White. Doc suggests a royal coach, with six white horses; his idea is rejected. Sleepy's idea for a bed is ultimately agreed upon, and Doc declares that he will 'fix' Snow White's name on the bed. Of course, he also oversees the bed's construction. During the bed-building sequence, Doc is seen with a chisel. Dopey, who is collecting fabric for the bed, sneaks up behind Doc and pulls his vest from under his coat. Before Doc knows what is going on, Dopey has returned to Happy with the vest, sending the jolly dwarf into hysteric laughs, but then Dopey takes advantage of this and steals his clothes too, and Happy catches him red-handed, giving him a scolding look. \n\nThe pompous, pot-bellied self-proclaimed leader of the seven dwarfs, Doc often bumbles and stammers, losing his train of thought mid-sentence or mixing up letters and sounds saying things like, \"search every crook and nanny\" or \"what are you and who are you doing?\" Nevertheless, he appears to hold complete authority over all the dwarfs except for Grumpy, who often objects to his decisions. This drives an ongoing rivalry between the two opposing forces, though Grumpy usually follows Doc's lead, nevertheless, with most situations.\n\nDoc encourages rational, organized behavior amongst the dwarfs and is particularly kind towards Snow White. He is the most vocal in accommodating and comforting her, allowing her to sleep in their beds and warning her against inviting strangers into the house. This also ties into Doc's more fatherly nature, which can also be seen when dealing with the comedically childish Dopey who, despite his incompetence, acts as Doc's right-hand-man; the head dwarf often acting as a caretaker of sorts, when with Dopey.\n\nHowever, despite being the leader and the individual the other dwarfs look to for guidance, Doc is fairly weak under pressure, often falling into mild panic attacks or becoming too flustered himself to think of a decent course of action when a situation of high importance falls upon the dwarfs, as seen during the return to the cottage, moments before meeting Snow White, and most notably during the climax. Fortunately, in times of such distress, the other dwarfs would assist in rallying a cohesive suggestion, with Doc following along before eventually taking leadership, once again.",

IT WAS A JOURNEY\n\nFor the last 5 years or so I would from time to time get this stuck on my head and have no idea what the name of the song was, I tried humming it, my mom said it sounded like the MCDONALD's donalds gingle (I'm not good at humming)\n\n~2 years ago it played in a supermarket, I was happy to see the song wasn't just my imagination, but I couldn't get the name then\n\nThis week it played in a uber but the radio didn't say the song name and the volume was too low for me to understand the lyrics, BUT!!! I had a moments of clarity, the voice, it was the same or at least very similar to the person who sang \"treat you better\", it was worth give it a try, but I forgot to do that that day\n\nNow, it's 05:27am for me, I suddenly remembered to search it, got into youtube... and forgot what I was doing\ud83d\ude10 3 minutes later I remembered\u2757\u2757 \"Oh right, search for the song\"\nI did it. There was it, \"treat you better by Shawn Mendes\", the voice really was similar!! Now that I had a name, I just needed to search for Shawn Mendes most popular songs from 6+ years ago, and here was it\n\"Stitches\" huh, the name didn't sound familiar, I thought it would take a while for me to find it, if the song I was searching for was even his, but I gave it a chance\n\nThe song started, I didn't think it was the one, but before I left the video it started, the chorus, the chorus I have been searching for for more than 5 years !!! It was finally here, I put a name to this that haunted me, and broke the curse, I KNOW THE NAME!! IT'S STITCHES!!! BY SHAWN MENDES!!! HAHAHAHA. \n\nI wanted to share my happiness, but, it's 5am, I should be sleeping, there is no one awake for me to do so, but I must at least leave it registered, an end of an era.\n\nEdit: spelling errors maybe there are more but I REALLY should be sleeping;;",
