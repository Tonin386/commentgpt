    "description": "Dua Lipa, the superstar artist followed by more than 88\u202fmillion admirers, is a creative whirlwind at the heart of the music scene, whose talent inspires and resonates with her millions of fans. She regularly lights up stages all over the world and delights audiences with the intoxicating rhythm of her hits. This force of nature, who has traveled a path from the United Kingdom to Kosovo and then onto the peaks of the global pop landscape, is the cover star of the September 2023 issue of Vogue France. This success does not stop the singer - and now actress - from sharing her passion for all things culinary with her Instagram followers. Naturally, we couldn\u2019t resist inviting the star to sample a range of traditional French dishes that have been elevated to the highest level of three-Michelin-starred gastronomy by chef H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Darroze at her restaurant, the Connaught. The result is a true demonstration of French culinary excellence in London.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_NbqlqRMNs\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsiitO1jauo\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khP5LeNk2VU\r\n\r\nFeaturing: Dua Lipa\r\nChef: H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Darroze\r\nDirector: Tom Ivin\r\nDirector Of Photography: Charlotte Croft\r\nCreative Director: Luke Spencer\r\nSenior Lead, Central Team: Tom Sandford\r\nSupervising Creative Producer: Leandra Behrens\r\nOn Set Producer: Amaury Delcambre\r\nSupervising Production Manager: Nikki Hopkins\r\nJournalist: Hugo Compain\r\nB-Cam Operator: Rebecca Richards\r\n1st AC: Esther Collins\r\nGaffer: Chaimaa Ormazabal\r\nSpark: Louis Johnson\r\nSound Recordist: Jermaine Monero\r\nHair Stylist: Peter Lux\r\nMakeup Artist: Lisa Eldridge\r\nCasting: Ad\u00e8le Ligerot\r\nEditor: Tom Gilfillan\r\nColourist:  Nathaniel Skeels\r\n\r\nCNE FRANCE\r\nVideo Development Lead: Louise des Ligneris\r\nVideo Programming Lead: St\u00e9phanie Amaya\r\nCreative Optimisation Manager: Marie Jaso\r\nHead Of Video: Thomas Leroy\r\nHead Of Editorial Content: Eug\u00e9nie Trochu\r\n\r\nLocation: H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Darroze at The Connaught\r\nWith Thanks To: The Connaught\r\n& H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Darroze\r\n\r\n#DuaLipa #Mukbang #VogueFrance\n\nSUBSCRIBE\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@voguefrance?sub_confirmation=1",
