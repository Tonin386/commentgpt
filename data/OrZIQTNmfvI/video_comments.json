        "text": "Romans 3:23 states: \"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;\". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 \"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.\". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: \"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\". Romans 10:13 states \"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\". \r\n\r\n   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.",

        "text": "The SMG Network (Stop Medical Genocide--Society for the Study of Organ Transplantation in China) held a seminar in Tokyo on April 2, 2023. The seminar exposed the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s (CCP) atrocities and called on the international community to help stop the persecution of Falun Dafa practitioners. \r\n\r\nRenowned Canadian human rights lawyer David Matas addressed the seminar and said, \u201cForced live organ harvesting of Falun Dafa practitioners is a criminal act. This is a glaring act of genocide.\u201d\r\n\r\nDirectors of medical journalist associations, newspaper reporters, company presidents and senior consultants of small and medium sized companies attended the event. \r\n\r\n\r\nCanadian human rights lawyer David Matas speaking at the seminar held in Tokyo on April 2, 2023.\r\n\r\nMr. Matas said, \u201cFalun Dafa practitioners\u2019 peaceful resistance of the persecution has created an impact. They have given me a lot of encouragement. The CCP\u2019s massive system for forced live organ harvesting has been ongoing for 22 years and the numbers are unbelievable.\u201d He called on the CCP to stop this atrocity.\r\n\r\nMr. Aoki, an expert in supporting small and medium-sized enterprises overseas, said, \u201cThe real China only exists when the CCP disintegrates. Falun Dafa practitioners have been persisting because of their faith and they firmly believe in the principles of Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance. They will definitely hold up and witness the day when the CCP collapses.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Hibino Morio has been following the issue of \u201cbrain death and organ transplant.\u201d He said, \u201cFalun Dafa practitioners pose no threat. It is their freedom to hold activities and it is acceptable in civilized countries. It is absolutely unacceptable to detain and deem these innocent people to be guilty. It is also unacceptable to harvest their organs.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Hashimoto said, \u201cFalun Dafa practitioners have committed no crime. It is absolutely terrible to know that they can vanish from the face of the earth in a day. We do not understand why this group of compassionate people are being persecuted. We support Falun Dafa practitioners and we cannot allow forced live organ harvesting to happen in China. We hope that practitioners overseas do not give up. We hope they persist till the end and make a big impact in the world.\u201d\r\n\r\nScreening of Human Harvest Documentary",

We all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. So we stand condemned before His righteous laws. At its core, sin is rebellion against God. Our sin separates us from God, the creator and sustainer of life. Jesus said, \u201cI am the way and the truth and the life\u201d (John 14:6). God is known as the great \u201cI AM.\u201d Life is in God. So, when we sin and become separated from God, we become separated from true life. But God so loved the world that He sent His only Son in our likeness to live a sinless life and die in our place and then He rose from the grave three days later to heaven. He did this so that we could have free will to choose life or death, so that we could choose Him. Through His Son Jesus Christ you can have eternal life freely by God\u2019s grace if you put your full faith in Him alone for your salvation. Then He washes your sins away and gives you a new heart to follow after Him. Tomorrow is not promised. I love you. Please choose life. God bless.",
