And, I always thought that dude, who sings \"When Doves Cry\" while looping the sound, and the music, makes that song, which I love anyway, sound really cool. There aren't enough words for me to describe Karis Eden's talent. And this guy, with the growling baritone, who sings \"Sound of Silence\" is simply enthralling, with that unique voice. I'd like to go on, and comment on how great the others are, too. But there are just too many really fantastic singers on this video to be able to do that. And no, I can't pick just one of them, as being my favorite one. They're all very different from each other, and I like listening to them sing for different reasons. So that's impossible for me to do. Sorry. For me, each singer I choose to listen to is my favorite singer, while I'm listening to them. I really think that's how it should be. Don't you?",

I'm 49 years old and there's an army guy that sang the song from Hawaii and it blows me away no matter who sings it especially Rihanna because whoever sings the song and even I can't sing worth a ship but when I sing it everybody has a different way of how this song deals with themselves and I don't care if your woman if your man if you're somebody in prison or whoever the fuk you are this song will shake you to the core if you really listen to it. The end this song is f****** amazing",

        "text": "May 11th, 2023 ..\nIt is amazing to see how many people who have been helped by musical artists like Manchester Orchestra and other musicians. The sad part about this entire mess is that Musical Artists and Propaganda Puppeteers and their Covert Networks compete for the same musical instrument . That being of course Mankind's emotional center within our minds. Musical artists are geniuses at creating songs that pull at our emotional heart strings. Propaganda Puppeteers are extremely crude, and every Propaganda Network upon entire Planetary System functions exactly the same minior variations due to language culture, yet still basically the same everywhere . After examining the linkage between Musical Artists and Covert Propaganda Arm of the Democratic Party, i realized that musical artists were being attacked various ways for a long time in America's Historical Timeline.  Rapp or hip-hop artists from minority voter blocks appear to be targeted more due to the fact minority voter blocks are heavily Propagandized controlled and owned by the COVERT Propaganda Arm of the Democratic Party. Gangsta  Rapp or Hip Hop artists, quite often from low income minority voter blocks with high elevated murder rates, tend to sing songs, which state that they have soldiers armed to the teeth and ready to cut loose . That enemies that people need to back or face consequences.  Coolio Gansta's Paradise is a song that lookd at that statistical anomaly in America which is the fact that the most dangerous thing to be in America is Black between ages of 14 to 45. Multiple scaling and governing factors create that statistical anomaly .. Statistics not reliable prior to 1980 . Yet from 1980 to yesr 2020 the Black on Black Murder rate was ~ 7000 Murders per year . That is 4500 elevated or above normal . Normal would be 2500 per year with the size of America's Black Population Fields.  Ssi from 1980 till 2020 that equates to 180;000 Black on Black Murders above the statistical norm.  Actually during the 2020 Presidential Election Cycle in America there was a statistical spike a 30% increase in murder across America.  In Black Population Fields that Historical Surge in murder rates equates to 2913 additional murdere. That takes the elevated murder rate of 180,000 to adjusted for Historical Surge to 182,913 . Theoretically if one understood all or most of the scaling and governing factors leading to such a high murder rate then one could have saved starting in 1980 all those 182,913 lives could have been saved. So Theoretically the next 40 years all things remaining the same will also geneate 180,000 plus preventable elevated murder rates again  That's what Coolio in Gansta's Paradise was singing about . Coolio, like many musical artists, sang songs seeking true positive forward progress. Coplio died due to fentanyl overdose on September 28th, 2022 . That date was and is very significant for me because my brother David was born September 28th, 1957 . On April 23rd 1972 he was killed at 15 years of age car accident. So September 28th has deeper meaning to ne than most . I discovered tbrough research that the Covert Propaganda Arm assassinates many types of people yet the assassinations are quite often camouflaged. All the scaling and governing factors which determine the Probabilities that a musical artist was assassinated are present with Coolio's tragic death  The date September 28th and the nature of the song Gansta's Paradise are key factors . Scaling and governing factors are also present in Dolores O'Riordan's death she was Beautiful Woman wrote and sang anti-war songs . She was found dead water alcohol drugs drowned .The date was January 15th, 2018 the one year anniversary of The Transition Project that fully engaged January 15th, 2017  The Project is designed to dismantle Propaganda Networks around the World as safely as possible. An Educational Project not An Act of War.  Just think people need to know certain things to help them make decisions as they move forward in time",
