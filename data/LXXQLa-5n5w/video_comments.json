        "text": "For those pageants, a group of very smart, but very mean, old men and women deconstruct the participants minds to decide which ones to destroy, and which ones to champion, with their questions. When you are no longer pretty to them, if they hate you to death, they will figure out how to break your heart, over and over again, until you can no longer even recognize your former self, a beautiful girl. Then, they will blame you for the tragedy they inflicted upon you and lock you away from everything that is good, to hide their crimes.",

I laugh because without money it's not funny. You can not get out the neighborhood without a plan and if a man could save em he would have not given her what he gave her.  Being ahead of the game is worth more than the fame! Focusing on name brand bags and saying rags to riches and we hate snitches and they end up in ditches is why the government has a trap and without a graduation cap they will target people because they poor but opportunities come to the door.",

Sitting here writing this as a cry because I dont even know what I genuinely look like.  Growing up I got called a pretty girl but now as a teenager my eyes opened and being able to see how judgmental and superficial our world has become. The older I got, the more self conscious I am about the unnoticeable things. Constantly being worried on how the world perceives me. Being a woman comes with so many factors of never feeling pretty enough.",

I came to terms that I have been dealing with an eating disorder since I was 12 (I was always called \"fat\" by my peers even though I was 5 ft 4 and 120 pounds). I quickly dropped to 110 and my family was always worried. I guess I hid behind the guise of being \"healthy\" when really, I wasn't. My entire hand HAS to fit around my wrist, I HAVE to have a thigh gap, I HAVE to feel and see my ribs, and I NEED to see my collarbone. Now, I'm eating whenever I'm hungry and try not to critique certain parts of my body. I still go for walks and eat healthy for longevity, not for appearances. It's freeing honestly.",

I\u2019ve learned to embrace my looks now but it\u2019s a lonely road. I\u2019m smart, fun, loving abs kind but yet still single because people judge me off how I look which is no fault of my own.

Ask Him to pour His Holy Spirit onto you and guide you through this life and walk with Him.  Jesus Christ died on cross just so that our sins can be forgiven. No sin is too great. Just believe in your heart that Jesus Christ died for us and resurrected from the dead. Confess with your mouth JESUS IS LORD. Call upon Him. The great I AM is coming soon! The creator of all things is soon to come! Time is running out! With love, I ask you to have faith. We all, believers and nonbelievers, will have to face His judgment someday.

I was glued to the monitor and was just balling my eyes out uncontrollably sad for the situation. It was strange because when I'm not manic I'm even keeled and often distant, but for some reason this song caught me in a mood where I put extra meaning into everything I heard like the words were speaking a story directly too me. It caught me at my weakest moment and although I still love the song, I pray to God I never get that caught up in sorrow again.",

When she says that she aspires to be happy, she continues to think of how she puts burdens and struggles on herself and the happiness is not real. This happens to so many people and we don't always realize when it's happening. We get so caught up in the busy way of the world that we just try to get through and don't know what else there is to be happy about. It can be hard to find happiness in this world or purpose in this world. There are always more people to please and there is always more work to be done. We need to try to stop looking at situations with our mind and start searching with our heart. We need purpose in life and it can be very hard to find. I don't have an answer for how to find purpose and stop living every moment like your an actor or pageant girl on a stage. It's different for all of us. I'm currently struggling with that. I am starting to feel like every day is the same like just another stage. I try so hard to express myself and I struggle. I'm just gonna keep trying and reaching out because I don't know what else to do. This song can apply to so many situations. To me, this song is so beautiful and it really helps me think clearly and express myself.",

I'm also sick of it! I want my own clinic for girls for eating disorders so they can have hope & get better & love themselves. \nBe who you are! Healthy,  happy, whole,  who God created you to be. Thanks Beyonce for this song & video!\nAlso i want to be open and honest,  I suffered from a eating disorder,  it reminds me of I went through.  I was always looking at the scale,  letting magazines determine if I was pretty or not, etc, I was miserable.( There's more though to what happen to me & how i ended up with anorexia nervousa)  I'm not doing that though  anymore...By the grace of God,  I'm better now! Very better!!\nThanks Beyonce!",

No pr\u00f3prio clipe a Be aparece mega produzida, magra de silhueta ampulheta, cabelo alisado, vestindo o que se entende por glamour. Ela faz o personagem da letra mas tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 assim nos outros clipes. Beyonc\u00e9 \u00e9 uma artista que quer encorajar outras pessoas a quebrar padr\u00f5es est\u00e9ticos mas ela n\u00e3o abre m\u00e3o dos procedimentos pra se adequar nesses padr\u00f5es. \u00c9 como se fosse uma pessoa diz que diz \"vc n\u00e3o precisa usar dourado pra brilhar, enquanto usa um vestido dourado que comprou com o dinheiro dos f\u00e3s em que ajuda na autoaceita\u00e7\u00e3o contra o dourado\". Ela alimenta os padr\u00f5es que critica. Amo o talento que tem como cantora, mas nessa quest\u00e3o eu acho hipocrisia. Assim como muitas cantoras. A Lizzo \u00e9 um caso que serve de exemplo real fazendo juz ao que diz, atrav\u00e9s da pr\u00f3pria viv\u00eancia. Cada vez mais percebo a tentativa das celebridades de vender uma imagem em cima das nossas necessidades. Mas a gente desconhece quem eles s\u00e3o. \u00c9 um pouco triste essa desilus\u00e3o, e tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 bom. Aquela imagem superestimada que tinha sido projeta no artista n\u00e3o existe, s\u00f3 \u00e9 poss\u00edvel de alcan\u00e7ar com produ\u00e7\u00f5es.",

        "text": "\"Perfection is a disease of a nation ... it's the soul that needs a surgery.\" \nI had almost fully forget the greatness and the supreme of this underated song of Beyonc\u00e9. This song has the very curable melodious lines and also the very motivational lyrics inside, it is the best tune to all the need encourage's women and also mothers of today's, the song encouraging the listeners and the audiences by its unintentional beauties of the all settings even the wonderful soundings also the fine production concepts in the visuals also the audios, the wise choosing of the contents of the music album itself is totally the most essential one. The painstaking efforts in this album were showing the much of productivities' Beyonc\u00e9, also shown the background music works had widely focus on the music qualities itself, the honesty and the purity of the great precious personalities of the very respectful the songstress Beyonc\u00e9 had fully put all of herself even all inside her to prove the prominent outstanding refined quality of the very high recommended high production value, even though maybe the contents of the repertoire were considered not commercial friendly perhaps, but the great well exertions and the flexibility among the pop and the alternative variable impressions still are in the very creative come such of outstanding especially among the R&B musics which are so mechanised now. In this worth mentioning album of Beyonc\u00e9, much of the remarkable talents behind the music scenes had blessed the album with their representative works also as their most favoured tears shedded literature to empower and give blessed to the final result of the album. The each specialty significant presentation of each song had the unique flowering surprise to let the audience to have the rawest facing to the creator Beyonc\u00e9 herself, in spite of her performing or her singing which were finely purposed in the album. Lastly, may wish the precious fanatic enthusiasm of Beyonc\u00e9 could continues prosperous as this precious prestigious album production also more productive and more suffices on the sharing of musics include the publishing of self opinions about arts and musics. Courage and may Beyonc\u00e9 stay enthusiastic always in music. All The Best. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",
