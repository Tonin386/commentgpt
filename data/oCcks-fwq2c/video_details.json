    "description": "Stephen Thompson | August 15, 2023\nThe Tiny Desk has hosted plenty of major pop, rock and hip-hop stars in its 15-plus years, but you'd be hard-pressed to find one more agreeable or self-effacing than Austin Richard Post. Whether lamenting the state of his singing voice, joking about his nerves or sitting slack-jawed in awe of the fantastic band his people had assembled for this show, Post had the bearing of a lottery winner who wouldn't even give himself credit for buying a ticket.\n\nBefore, during and after the show, Post Malone was a joy to have around. But he also just happened to bring a few of the biggest pop hits of the 21st century: Set-opener \"Sunflower,\" for example, has been certified eighteen-times platinum by the RIAA since its release in 2018 \u2014 that's an all-time record \u2014 while the 2017 single \"I Fall Apart\" and 2019's \"Circles\" lag behind at a mere ten-times platinum apiece. \"Enough Is Enough,\" which closes this set, enjoys no such designation, but give it time: A track from Post Malone's new album Austin, it's only been out for a few weeks.\n\nSo enjoy this set for what it is: one of the world's biggest stars, performing a few of the world's biggest songs, each set to a luminous arrangement. Post Malone himself seems surprised by how great this Tiny Desk concert sounds, and that's not just the humility talking.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Sunflower\"\n\"I Fall Apart\"\n\"Circles\"\n\"Enough Is Enough\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nAustin Post: lead vocalist, guitar \nHannah Juliano: vocalist\nElliot Aguilar: vocalist\nChauncey Matthews: vocalist\nKola Rail: vocalist\nDestin Johnson: drums\nEmily Rosenfield: guitar \nBobby Wooten: bass \nLouis Bell: piano\nKevin Kuh: strings \nFrancesca Dardani: strings \nKiku Enomoto: strings\nKirin McElwain: strings\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducers: Bobby Carter, Suraya Mohamed\nDirector/Editor: Kara Frame\nAudio Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nCreative Director: Bob Boilen\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Zayrha Rodriguez, Sofia Seidel\nAudio Assistant: Hannah Gluvna\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Catie Dull\nTiny Desk Team: Hazel Cills\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #postmalone",
