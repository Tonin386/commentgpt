If it did I missed it whilst trying to make out the words of that line.  All I could hear was a 'b' sound so as that line had other letters it confused me even more.  Still there was enough irony in the song and mv to make it entertaining.  But that's all.",

Definitely inspired. \n\n\"In the Puranic scriptures of Hinduism, Vaivasvata Manu appears in the story of the great flood which seems like a curious blend of the Biblical stories of Adam, Noah and Jonah. The central characters here are Manu and a fish called Matsya (who is an avatar of the god Vishnu; in the earliest appearance of the myth, the Shatapatha Brahmana though, the fish is identified with the god Brahma).\n\nAccordingly to the narrative, Manu ends up with a small fish in his hands during his ablutions, which appeals to him to save it from bigger fish and in return, promises to protect him from an impending catastrophic deluge. The fish asks Manu to transfer it to a jar , where it grows bigger, and thereafter, to a pit because it can fit it in it. Then finally, back into the ocean where it can grow large and strong. When the flood is near, it asks Manu to build a boat. When the waters rise, the fish rescues Manu by leading his boat by its horn to mountains of the north (the Himalayas).\"",

I didn\u2019t mind it. The bad thing was we had a bad boss and one of them is pigs all the time because the inspectors would come in the in the backyard with a cricket make a mess and they have to get down the street for us and we worked out front but they still called us of eggs with from another country was awesome America.

It's really hard to forget someone we really love and adore. For us, they are special and maybe it'll stay like that forever.\nAgain, it's a lesson how harry had to let the fish go because in the end love is all about sacrifices and it's better to be apart and stay healthy than staying together and harm each other. sometimes when people grow, they grow apart.",

He did such things to show me that he likes me, but never told me it's because I know he wasn't sure about me. There's something that made both of us away from each other (family, friends or skills?).\n\nIn this music video, I was the fish that gave happiness to his life. Everything we did was fun and real. While he's that person who knew that the fish was such a great gift to him but had to set her free because he needed to protect her from so much danger that would happen to them in the future. (Judgement from other people)\n\nIt was a good lesson for me. In reality we don't have to change for someone in order to be accepted. We have to fight on something that would give us happiness in life and who would accept us no matter who we are, or where we came from. I knew this would happen, so I haven't had the chance to say I adored him too! But grateful for all the lessons that he left. Salamat! :) take care.",

        "text": "Decided to watch this again few years later. After watching the video and listening to the song I found a meaning behind the lyrics and the concept.\n\nYou seee if you come to the comment section you are moslt likley gonna see the comment that says something in the lines of \"there's many fish in the sea but he only adores one\", I mean we all know the meaning of that right. This basically sums up the video.\n\nNow look, the lyrics talk about a person that wants to give their love the the person they chose. He/she wants to take care of that person, wants to adore them, make them feel loved and I guess you can say start a relationship if you think about it in those terms.\n\nThe video shows us Harry chose a certain fish from the sea. He took care of it, and loved it, and grew close to it I guess you van say that. He did all he could to adore and take care of the fish... but unfortunatley they couldnt be together forever or for a long time\n\nBasically the entire message is that sometimes you have to let go of the things/ppl you love the most or adore the most in order for them and others to be happy or in order for things to work out and not create problems. Sometimes/most of the time we can't have the one we adore the most.....its the sad truth but that's reality............I hate reality \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",

Please let go of this world. Open your heart to God please. Soon. As soon as possible. I hope to always be part of your life if you decide to do good too. I care about you very much. You make me cry. You are very sweet inside. Let go of the bad. I wish you the best. You have my love. You live in part of my heart always. Take care. Don't be upset at me. Save this. Many kisses and I wish I could hug you tightly and look into your loving eyes. How you look at the fish. And how funny and sweet the way you wake up scared thinking of it. Your love breaks my heart. Part of you is pure and beautiful. Let go of this world. The best of you will flourish. Take care always and look for good. Te quiero mucho \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",
