Those pro's listening, talk about how she sounds like anyone else, if it wasn't for Finneas. \nLive, isn't truly live. She's singing on an audio 'bus' with about 30 different 'returns' on her voice, adding those effects 'live'. \n\nPut her in a room with you, singing to you face to face and you'd assume she was having an off day. \n\nFacts are facts people.",

I've had a pretty shit year health wise which has given me plenty of time to reflect on how I am feeling and who I am as a person. I'm bi. I am bisexual. That is who I am, without question nor debate and deep down, I knew this however I was too afraid to approach it, acknowledge it and be proud of it. I'm 27 and I have felt a great fear since 25 that I am too old to only just recognize this part of myself and most importantly tell people. This song allowed me to process my emotions, challenge my thoughts and perceptions of how people would react and how I feel in myself. It allowed me to acknowledge that things will be okay. Maybe not right in this moment, but it will. I am who I am and I should not be ashamed of that and as Nick Nelson would say... \"I'm bi...actually.\" :)",

I think this song touches people in many different ways, first love & teenage angst, family and parental conflict, abuse, relationship breakdown, the list goes on.\nHer voice is so clear, sounds amazing live, nothing inappropriate which makes a change, and extremely fitting to the film, yet stands alone.

Believe in him He came to save us from hell and eternal suffering, also turn from your sins repent which is changing your life to follow the way of God and not your way, your way will lead you into a pit of despair I know it, my way lead me in a pit straight to hell, but Jesus rescued me and he can rescue you. He can grant a peace and joy unfelt, and be your closest friend always there, This is the gospel \n\nJesus Christ, son of God, died for our sins, was buried, and rose again on the third day. After he went to his tweleve disciples and many others before ascending into heaven eternally triumphant over all his enemies and making it so that there is now no condemnation for sin  to all those who believe, but only everlasting joy.

I'm. 53 and she also resonated with me when her first album came out, mostly from long ago, but still, I lived that album and the other songs of her I didn't know. So egen her second album came out, I was a bit dissapointed, coz it was very different. But that album is now another favorite of mine and this song is another little pearl from Billie and Finneas. He should do more abt his own career, he's such a good writer, producer and artist in his own right, but he didn't even really promote his own album 2 years or so ago, he didn't go on tour or perform in other ways, not that I know off anyway. Such a great pair \u2764it\u2763\ufe0f\u2763\ufe0f\u2763\ufe0f",
