        "text": "\ud83d\udc4d \ud83c\udfa4 I don\u2019t like, or think it\u2019s fair, when some people compare completely different vocalists/performers/songs by saying that one is the  \u2018best\u2019 or the \u2018greatest\u2019 ever. To me it\u2019s like comparing apples \ud83c\udf4e and oranges \ud83c\udf4a - they can each be good, but they\u2019re NOT the same, other than both being a fruit, and a matter of preference. BUT, in this situation, I think it\u2019s fine to make comparisons between the SAME \ud83c\udfa4ist and their OWN various versions of the same song. That being said, imo THIS is one of Adele\u2019s better renditions - there\u2019s no \u2018pomp and circumstance\u2019, orchestra, background vocals/musicians, loud and noisy audience, etc. running interference - just a very \u2018low key\u2019 and relaxed style sound, which is what makes it sound so good to me \ud83d\udc4d!",

He made a playlist containing 6 songs that was edited the day he passed. This is one of the 6 songs. With the method he used, he was dead after about 30 minutes, probably unconscious around 12 minutes. I like to think that it was peaceful for him with his music on.

        "text": "The serpent mentioned here in genesis was a creation of the Most Hight El Elyown El (father of Yahweh) and not of Yahweh (the Son of El Elyown El the most High) who spoke the truth and got punished for it. Man did become like god knowing good and evil by eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil but they didn\u2019t gain immortality because the tree of life (a concept stolen by the jews from the Ancient Egyptian) was denied to them. The serpent he mentioned isn\u2019t found in history because the whole genesis story was stolen from the Mesopotamian religion and by jews and made to seem like it came from them when it clearly did not\n\nThe serpent told the truth: \n\n\u201cFor God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.\u201d (Genesis 3:5)\n\nGod confirms the serpents truth and said:\n\n \u201cBehold, the man has become like one of us in knowing good and evil.\u201d (Genesis 3:22)\n\nThe serpent told a second truth:\n\n\u201cBut the serpent said to the woman, \u201cYou will not surely die.\u201d (Genesis 3:4)\n\nGod lied to Adam and Eve and said:\n\n\u201cbut of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.\u201d (Genesis 2:17)\n\nNotice that the day that they ate the unknown fruit (and no it\u2019s not an apple or a fig like some would like you to think) they didn\u2019t die. Keep also in mind that man wasn\u2019t created immortal otherwise god wouldn\u2019t of denied them the tree of Life. Theres no passage that says that god created man to be immortal when god already knew that man will populate the world now image a world where we have people who can\u2019t die and it\u2019s over populated now you have a major problem because by then man is now unstoppable and the tower of babel wouldn\u2019t of been destroyed because these same men would of rebuilt them back up but god fear a tower reaching heaven which made no sense because towers cant reach heaven at all. We would have immortal evil men enslaving benevolent men, women and children",

        "text": "When i was a child i lived with my father for what seems like a lifetime, he was (still is i guess) an alcoholic with anger issues, he would come home after a long day of work drunk, and he always wanted to see my school stuff to see what i did that day, and every mistake i did that day he would pick a bit of that anger and turn into rage, and he would beat me, not slaps or something like that, he would punch me, trow stuff at me, i lost count of how many times i had to lie on how i got that black eye, i got depressed but i didn't know what that was, i had no access to internet so for me it was normal to cry before sleeping and to be sad all the time and that went on for a while until the day i met the love of my life. Sometimes i was allowed to leave the house and play with my friends on the streets and that's where i met her, we studied at the same school but she was one year younger so not in the same classroom so we never met at school, she wasn't allowed to leave her house either but in my country all the houses have fences so i would stay outside and she would stay inside and we would talk for hours, we started going and coming from school together and i liked that, but i was too naive to know that it was love, thankfully one day she said she liked me and while i didn't know what that really meant i knew that i had to say it back and so i did, and we became boyfriend and girlfriend and oh boy how my life changed, i didn't care anymore if i would come home and suffer my fathers rage, i would only think of her and how happy she made me, we would always kiss behind a house that was in construction when coming from school and it was perfect. Time went on and i moved houses, but it was no issue because we still did half the way home together, only bad thing is that we lost our kissing spot and we didn't find another one. The end of the year came and that meant that we wouldn't see each other again for a while (at least it was what i thought), and on the last day of school we were coming home and there it was, the perfect spot to give that last kiss, behind a parked semi, but i got cold feet because it was right in front of a bar my father frequented and i was afraid that someone would see and tell him, she insisted but i said no, and that's my worst regret in life, that day was the last day i saw her because i came to my mothers house during the holidays and i never came back because my mother found out that my father would beat me and she took my custody. Its been almost 15 years and i still think of her, i've tried so many times to find her trough facebook, instagram and etc but its like looking for a needle in a haystack, someday i still hope to find her and thank her for what she did to me, the reason i wrote this wall text here is because her mother loved listening to Adele, so there was always an Adele song playing in the background while we were talking, so every time an Adele song plays i remember her. Amanda, if you, somehow, finds this i hope you know that you were the love of my life and hopefully i find you again someday and we can talk about everything",

That doesn't mean we lost the love for one another.  We just lost track of what mattered cause in society, love doesn't pay the bills. Love doesn't always get us to where we wanna be, and sometimes we just have to sacrifice what we have to be where we wanna be. Our choices in life arent perfect and don't always lead us to happiness, but we gotta make choices.Even if what we have is something that will never be found again.\n\n\nAnyways.

For me, memories of me and my cousins playing hide and seeks, card games, play station games and video games on our phones. Time passed and the games we played altered. Now that each of us is too occupied on our own --  studies, work and newly built family for some. Small talk, cold atmosphere is all that presents when we happen to meet. Time flies... Younger me was so confused why things have changed dramatically like that. I can now accept the fact that life goes on... and we are on our own.",
