Having listened to almost everything Wilco and related folks have to offer, this KEXP sessions (and mention to all the NPR sessions) are maybe Wilco's finest work. If nothing else, it's what turned me on to Wilco in 2015. Thanks KEXP!",

And not just with Wilco.  I think any band.\n\n\nI remember reading in the LA Weekly decades ago an article talking about how, at that time, U2 was the last \"real band.\"  Meaning, the last of bands where the label put time into a band and developed them and stuck with them.  The point of the article was that it is so much easier to develop a one hit wonder/bubble gum garbage pop band, maximize revenue, cast them aside, and do it again so labels quit investing in bands with more depth and talent.  Sound familiar? Like some dumbass telling a band they can have their album back?  \n\n\nI first saw Nels Cline play with Mike Watt at Slims in San Francisco on his Ballhog or Tugboat tour.  Nels was one of many guest performers but he stole the show.  Blew my mind when he joined Wilco.  Glenn is a master, John is so solid. Sansone and Jorgensen... Come on.  And these dudes can play ANYTHING. BTW, pat killed it on keyboards a couple of months ago (5/15/2019) with Mavis Staples at the Ryman.\n\n\nThank you Wilco.",

I understand that they're sound musicians, and I can tell that the sound engineer did one helluva job on this live set, buuuuuuut it just sounds like backyard folk music to me.

It's like they are sincere and are competent technically and have the right influences but they don't have one compelling melody in their whole catalogue, and that isn't an exaggeration.  People who follow them are essentially musically challenged, (but not culturally), like people who listen to Creed or modern pop country radio.  - Good they've been able to tour and have some success.  They seem like nice guys.  - For those of you with no life like me tonight who are reading this listen to old rem or the replacements or tom petty or Big Star or Jeff Lynne.
