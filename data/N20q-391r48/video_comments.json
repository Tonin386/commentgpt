Rich and \nEvil dudes try to diminish me. \nThey can\u2019t finish me. Snitching \nFails. Justice prevails \nWhen my gun stops glitching. \nI love b\u2026tching \nWhen sorrow irritates me. \nI go crazy. Hell awaits thee. \nFires are ama-ama-amazing. \nEnemies burn in my crematorium. \nIt\u2019s a sad story and I get dic-dic-dictatorial. \nRevenge creeps under my corium. \nI speak Vic-vic-victorian when I pull the trigger. \nMy shadow gets big-big-bigger in my crematorium-orium-orium\u2026 \n \n[Verse 1] \nThoughts attack me exactly when demons try to whack me. \nRelatives don\u2019t back me because they envy me. Frankly, \nI hate \u2018em too. F\u2026ck my shaky roots! They won\u2019t make it. Boots \nFall on \u2018em. Laudanum is all they drink to think like a murderer. \nI order-order rum to drown my sorrow. Run away from \nThe horror. Fun is a rare guest. I do my best to earn a dollar. Slum \nIs my home town. When I wanna glow crowds \nLaugh and get slow. Chow is cold now. Hungry like a mole. Out \nFor weeks. Gnats bite my cheeks. I feel bad like creeps. \nDragons fly. Deeds pile up like beats. Cops die on streets. \nBut I don\u2019t care. I wanna grow. Lairs make me vomit like a crow. Dare \nSpeak the truth after chic booze. I live under snow. Mares \nI feed on help me grow. Bear a grudge against the dope mayor. \nI know-know the truth is out there. \n \n[Chorus] \nThoughts in my head. Thoughts in my head. \nDemons gonna jump-jump. \nMemory\u2019s dead. Memory\u2019s dead. \nSparrows drinking blood-blood. \n \n[Verse 2] \nTalking to the mirror. I ain\u2019t a hero. They call me Loser, man! \nThat\u2019s why I get woozy. Pen is my sword I like to use again. \nA pussy\u2019s phlegm makes me sick. That\u2019s a crazy flick. \nP\u2026rn is amazing sh\u2026t. When I get lazy, a hit \nDispels my wistfulness. I miss-miss fool pests. \nI never eat to the full. Jest to revive my mood. Yes. \nI burn a fool\u2019s nest when I steal some cool eggs. \nIf Hunger whispers, I do whatever it wants. Woo \nPretty b\u2026tches to get richer like Wu. \nPlay and mix blues when chicks snooze. \nI give \u2018em bricks. Lose myself in Eminem\u2019s music. \nI crave for a happy end. My bang crew\u2019s sick \nLike bachelor John Cusack. F\u2026ck the society! \nGonna be a star. Firing bazookas. Lucas inspires me \nTo write stories fuelled by anxiety when bastards dehire me. \nI get high and dream of islands. Shooting vipers \nIs fun. Spooky spiders, go home! Leave me alone. \nGonna make my groupie ride me. \n \n[Chorus] \nThoughts in my head. Thoughts in my head. \nDemons gonna jump-jump. \nMemory\u2019s dead. Memory\u2019s dead. \nSparrows drinking blood-blood. \n \n[Verse 3] \nMy life is an endless alphabet. Idiots keep laughing at \nMy f\u2026ck-ups. Madhouse understaffing and \nEmptiness cause my laughter. At\u2026 large \nLike Burrows. My arrows keep attacking rats \nWho live in the jungle shacks. They die of hunger. Gnats \nBite \u2018em too. My crew can juggle bats. \nDinosaurs in the tunnel. Max goes mad \nBecause of getting fungal. Axe after axe. \nTheir heads bangle. Cats chase Bob\u2019s uncles. Vats \nFull of sharks and brats. Enjoy the jungle, lads! \nSwords punish foes. Ghosts vanish. Gross. \nI ain\u2019t uppish. Show ain\u2019t over. I\u2019m a soldier. \nGonna break your nose. Sorry for my sad story. Gore \nOn my hands. Blast lorries. Law is toilet paper. \nHatred\u2019s victims galore. War after war. \nVirtual reality bothers me. You don\u2019t cure mentality. \nSo I dally-dally. D wanna placate me. They hate me. \nBrutality is a loco\u2019s path. Tread on the broken glass. \nK\u2026ll bogans. Dust and locals\u2019 ash make me laugh \nLike Joker Slash. \n \n[Chorus] \nThoughts in my head. Thoughts in my head. \nDemons gonna jump-jump. \nMemory\u2019s dead. Memory\u2019s dead. \nSparrows drinking blood-blood. \n \n[Outro] Policeman: \nGood evening, mam! We\u2019ve found a guy who claims to be a founder. Why \nDid you release \u2018im? His reason is sick. He offered me a brick. \nParamedics fixed his fried chick. \nPsychiatrists will help your son recover. \nHe says that he is undercover. \nHe chases demons who killed his lover. \nIs Rihanna your son\u2019s wife? \nIs he playing with a big knife? \nMam, I think your son is tripping. He should be sipping \nSome syrup in a madhouse. \nNo. There is neither a mouse nor a louse. Mam, your son will forget such bouts. \nPlease don\u2019t worry! He will be treated in the best madhouse-house-house. \n \n\u00a9 Norfum 2023.",

Paying a homage to his past ideas while also venturing off into new unknown territory, reflected through the sounds present in the album. Some vibes we recognise from previous tracks and songs, while there are some completely unknown vibes and sounds that we tradtionally hear from travis. Also the unknown territory part is reflected through the white background of rodeo now being black on utopia which resembles change and also the feelings of ambiguity and uncertainty\".
