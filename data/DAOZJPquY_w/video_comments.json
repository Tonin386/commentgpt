It brings me back to when I lost my mom in 2019, and how I partied so hard for almost a year, overspending, and angry at the world, stumbling from one blackout to the next. Every lyric hits. It's beautiful to see how far I've come and how much I've healed; this song makes looking back on those struggled times beautiful, because there was a lot of beauty to it, but it was never meant to be forever. Really great song. Didn't know I was a Post Malone fan, but this is definitely a gateway song for an incredible artist.",

Post Malone uses different techniques to decrease the size of the ice block, until eventually it is just an ice cube that he puts into his drink. But is this success, or is this just starting the cycle all over? Is the drink alcohol, and is alcohol the boulder? I admire that the nature of the video is to leave it somewhat open-ended, so that is one possible interpretation that leaves room for other interpretations, as well.\n\nAnd the beats combined with the melody of this song -- EXQUISITE. \ud83d\udcaf",

He bled to death trying to get sober. Something told me to reach out to you. I know about your struggles with alcoholism and something told me to write you to tell you that God loves you and he wants you to turn away from alcohol and drugs. You have a daughter and she looks to you. I really don't know why I am writing this. It must be the holy spirit guiding me to write you. I am just an old woman getting close to 60 and am a small business owner. Just can't bare to think what your daughter will feel if you succumb to drinking like my brother did. I am broken hearted losing my best friend. I love your music. You are a truly talented musician. May God be with you. Michelle.",

I don't mean to force you to believe in Him, just to let willing people know more about Him.\nIf you don't already know about it, I just want to let you know that Jesus truly loves you. He Is The One Who died for you, so that you don't die in your sins, but are forgiven. Yes, that's the Good News: He loved you so much, that He was whipped, crowned with thorns, falsely accused of the blasphemy, nailed to the cross and even though He felt a lot of pain, after it all happened, He asked His Father (God Almighty) to forgive all of us, for all of us are people who killed Him with our sins. Thanks to Him, You can actually go to Heaven and forever be happy. In Heaven, there will be no pain, just a huge happiness. Nothing you have ever felt in your life can compare to the joy that is coming if you just follow Jesus and accept Him as your Savior. It will be worth it, you'll see it. No god did what Jesus does every single day. I saw the spiritual realm. I saw a demon. He was at my house for about 3 years and guess what? He went away after I called out to Jesus one night. I called Him for help and the demon left, and never came back (note that I've never drunk, vaped, smoked). He Is our Rock and Strength, our Hope and Joy. Every single day, He heals people, even the ones who heard from the doctors that nothing will be able to cure that medical condition. He even rises people from the dead! Have You ever heard about the story of John Smith's life? He drowned, when the medical team found him in the water, he was almost dead. In the hospital, they told him that there are very low chances that he will be alive. Then, they told Joyce Smith, John's mother, that if he survives, he will never be able to come back to doing anything by himself. However, Joyce Smith didn't lose hope and kept praying for him. Do you know what happened? He survived, and the team from the hospital has no other explanation than it being a miracle. He came back to living and doesn't need any help from people, for he can walk and do everything else by himself, even though his brain was damaged. Trust me, God Is still alive and does the miracles that are as big as the ones He did perform 2000 years ago. Just trust in Him and pray, so that He lets you show His glory, too. Accept Him as your Savior and Friend, and build a relationship with Him. He just wants to have this kind of relationship like you and your friends do. Even if you don't believe in what I wrote, just give God Almighty, The Holy Spirit and Jesus Christ a chance. You won't regret it in the end",

Nobody\nTake me outside, I'm a little too high\nPaid a little too much for the time of my life\nWhen money ain't a problem, everyone's sliding\nEven when I tell myself that I\nDon't want to sober up\nThe sun is killing my buzz, that's why they call it mourning\nThought I was strong enough\nThrew my bottle at the sky, said, \"God that's a warning\"\nDon't want to sober up\nTry to keep it inside, but I just want to pour it\nThought I was strong enough\nGot a lot of shit to say, couldn't fit it in the chorus\nSource: LyricFind",
