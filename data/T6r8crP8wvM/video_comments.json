We all know couples like this.  She handicaps him and he let's her.  Maybe he needs someone that can also be his mommy.  And Hailey is willing to do it in exchange for being Mrs. Bieber.  Can't we just let these two dependent people ride off into the sunset so Selena can have some peace??  I can't imagine my life forever being tied to one of the trash men I dated when I was too young to have higher standards.",

I think they are still there for him. They may not like Hailey but Justin's fans still love him & they may unfollow him but I think they are still there.
