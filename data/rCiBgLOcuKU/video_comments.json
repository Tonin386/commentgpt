Rap used to mean something, now it all about who can shock the audience with how much sex and obscenity you can put in. I'm sorry but these females are all the same, Cardi, Lil Kim, Megan Thee Stallion.  What is the difference in them? \nAt least mumble-rap is finally starting to fade out, that whole thing was terrible. I'm not trying to diss anyone. I'm sure they are all hard working girls just trying to make a buck, or a million bucks. I just miss the rap from the 80s and 90s. Thanks for listening.",

You stoled my song\u2019s & twisted around the lyrics, and made it so trashy. \u201cWTFWYT\u201d The beautiful diamond \u201cPlayboy Bunny\u201d necklaces doesn\u2019t belong to you.   You love to steal & never buy luxury items/goods with your own legitimate money. Remember you came from a poor refugee camp in the late 80\u2019s and was living in Puerto Rico until the USA Government found housing for you. Bernie Sanders was nice enough to adopt you as his daughter with your Sister Hennessy.  You paid someone to steal my \u201cPlayboy Bunny\u201d diamond necklaces from my luxury boutique, as well your Sister stoled my \u201cHello Kitty\u201d diamond necklace from my other Luxury Jewelry Boutique in (ATL).  I have an inquiry, you also stoled more gems during the George Floyd riots and UAL London College of Fashion (2007). The \u201cInvasion of Privacy\u201d first album cover belongs to Lady Gaga, I created the album cover for her only,  you & your trifling husband stoled it from me. You thought I wouldn\u2019t respond nor, remember my diamonds necklaces on your neck,  as well sister neck. Also why would you allow your Daughter to wear my diamonds \u201cMinnie Mouse\u201d necklace with my Yellow Rainbow Crystal Herm\u00e9s Birkin.  The diamond \u201cMinnie Mouse\u201dnecklace and \u201cYellow Rainbow Crystal Herm\u00e9s Birkin\u201d was  given to me by a very wealthy Arab family in the late 80\u2019s when I was living in  San Juan, Puerto Rico.  You had the nerve to post the picture on instagram knowing your daughter is wearing stolen luxury goods. FYI I don\u2019t follow you nor, go on your trashy Social Media account, I saw your picture on a website gossip blog.  On Feb 2020, I ran into your Fashion Stylist \u201cKollin Carter\u201d at the Essence Fashion Show during New York Fashion Week.  When Kollin Carter saw me, he ran out of the building so fast from the emergency exit doors, and that was the funniest highlight of the night.",

Sorry, I like Cardi, she is funny and cute but c'mon when are we gonna see someone with some good, ORIGINAL music. Rap these days is all sounding the same. I grew up in the 80s and 90s and the rap songs back then had a message, sometimes the message was hard but they rapped about real life, the stuff going on in their neighborhoods. What message does this song/video have? If someone can tell me the difference between this and Anaconda...I will admit Im wrong.",

And can we talk about that hook? It's so catchy, I can't get it out of my head. Every time I hear it, I just wanna get up and dance. And the video? So lit! Cardi looks like a boss bitch, and the visuals are just \ud83d\udd25.What I love about Cardi is that she always brings this unapologetic energy to her music. She's just so confident and doesn't care what anyone thinks. It's like she's telling us to be ourselves and be proud of it. And the way she switches up her flow? Genius. It just shows how versatile she is as an artist. She's always pushing boundaries and taking risks, and that's what makes her so iconic. I can't wait to see what Cardi B has in store for us next. She's gonna keep slaying and I'll be here for it, always. \ud83d\udc96",

So Queen Latifah, Jean Grae, MC Lyte, Lauren Hill, Missy Elliot, Medusa, Tekitha(Blue Razberry) Washington fought to be heard thru their talent, and these bitches shake their ass, talk about dick and rap these God awful lyrics and become famous millionaires!! The music game is so unfair!!",
