It was a little slow, low-budget-like, and too dramatic and less comic. Besides that it was probably a bad idea to have it\u2019s release so close to \u2018Spider-Man Multiverse\u2019 cinematic run too. It had it\u2019s moments though. One memorable scene was where he had to save the falling babies. Detractors claim that if GOD was good or even existed bad things would/couldn\u2019t happen. That\u2019s a misnomer if I ever heard one. It\u2019s a good thing GOD plans a major do over at the end eh? Are you falling? Let JESUS catch you anew! What else are you gonna do? Trip, fall, scream all the way down, crash and burn (forever)?",

Iv experiences it before, you feel like your falling into a deep pit and you just can\u2019t climb out. It\u2019s pain, the pain is stronger than your will to live. It\u2019s worth it. Every time I listen to this song I end up crying. Only song I have ever cried for. You can hear the pain, feel the pain. The amount of panic and anxiety attacks I have had listening to this is surreal. Too many to count. I know that someone like Harry feels this, and it hurts so so bad. His life ain\u2019t perfect. Neither is our. We need to accept that. You are enough. Push through one day at a time. You will push through that dark hole, we believe you will. Scratch that, we know you will. I\u2019m sorry for the rambling I really needed to vent. I know this song was written 3 years ago but it\u2019s meaning only gets stronger. I feel like for once I can let go of all the weight on my shoulders bearing me down, be myself for once. I don\u2019t know who I am and after 13 years I still don\u2019t know. My parents are alcoholics. I have a job at our local grocery store, this is a school chrome book and I don\u2019t bother making friends because I don\u2019t have time for them. Turn away anyone who asks. I have my parents and myself to take care of, my brother left 2 years and 157 days ago. Today was not a favorite of mine, and though I really really try so hard I just don\u2019t see the point in trying to survive day after day anymore. When I grow up no one will be there to support me. I\u2019ll have children, a husband, and what else. What until then? I know Harry will never see this, and I doubt anyone else ever will. I just want to put it out there that some of us are really struggling to find a purpose. Harry has taught me that that purpose may not always be clear but it is there. He has saved my life in more way than one. Iv given up cutting a few months back and am feeling a little better mental health wise. So thank you, you may never see this but that does not what you have done for me Harry. Thank you.",

How I wish they will get back together now that they're older and more mature. \"I'm falling again\" could mean he's in love again with the same person \"And when I felt like I was an old cardigan, under someone's bed, you put me on and said I was your favorite\". Could this mean like a love is rekindling? Excuse me for my theories but it broke my heart when they broke up. Taylor's songs about Harry was so insane, she was really madly in love that time.",

This is the song that my granddaughter danced to a few months ago so beautifully and is what started me on the journey to learn who the singer is. I didn't follow the 1D days but enjoy hearing their songs. However, this man is the gem that rose from the ashes and it's very apparent that he is doing exacty what God has gifted him to do. Shine on, Harry. You reach new fans daily and you are making a difference in this world. Be well.",

Is filled with emotions, I cried every time I hear it specially when he says, I get the feeling you never need me again because this how I feel about my situation right now and is my worst fear, that\u2019s becoming a reality, but after listening to this song, I switched to fine line, and he brings me hope, when he says we\u2019ll be alright. Harry manages to give us hope with all his songs. His lyrics come with the heart and it feels that he is on our minds. This why he deserves all the awards he could get!",
