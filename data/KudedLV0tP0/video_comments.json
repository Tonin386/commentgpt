That force which unites people and might be a bit too mainstream and smooth to be accepted by the snobs, but the fans sure get it. But comparisons are tough because TS seems like such a canny person, not cynical, but highly self aware and determined to control her image for the betterment of herself and the fandom. Anyway, looking forward to this.",

You are my wedding bride, there is no way to escape the altar because you will be called up for mandatory military service for 4 years of organic purification for nuptials and pregnancy with an heir child with me.\r\nUntil when will I have to continue loved you with your photographs without the government procedure with Crown Prince prisoner on the bed in the room passionate with your delicious seductive photographs. I woke up in this photo and as we always I went to the bathroom to brush my teeth and other organic needs on our bodies in the morning, to finally get through the routine of a day without any future plans, I'm always compose my themes with your eyes in this your hot face, but it would be much more true to have you in bed with me when I want you so with me. \r\nWe are lost without a purpose because the lottery that comes with financial protection insists on keeping us in perpetual quarantine, in the praying at the altar for the resurrection of Christ, this does not validate any miracle, even with tragedies giving us support to take position, and In the end everything, we remain static like statues in the square. It would not be for this procedure that we exist in this activity of surveillance and control of a civilization as a prophet and guardian of this civilization, something needs to happen and everything is linked to lotteries, while we remain studying in control of research but with a curse making any progress impossible.
