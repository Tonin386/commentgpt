My son couldnt believe how good she was Live. This Coronation Performance Proves she is a true star and so down to earth. I'm also grateful to her for her charity work to stop child Trafficking. Also glad she took her Mum with her. I've read people said she was Breathy I didnt think that. and the crowd of thousands didnt think that. Well Done to Katy Perry.",

She was out of tune many times, with asthmatic breath, don't reach a couple of notes, and for the most difficult part of the song you have a powerful backing vocals to cover her inability to reach the notes of her song. She don't nail nothing, she did a average job. If you all are satisfied with average, good for you, good for her.",

Even with these amazing backing vocals supporting her, we can hear the out of air and cutting in the middle to breath. There wasn't power in there. Lionel Richie at 73 showed how to do it. Singing and dancing will All Night Long, he was really good.",
