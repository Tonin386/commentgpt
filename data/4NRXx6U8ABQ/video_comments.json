        "text": "\"I've been tryin' to call, I've been on my own...\" The Weeknd croons in his signature falsetto on this 2019 hit. And we already know it's going to be another brooding tune about loneliness and longing.\r\n\r\nBut wait, suddenly we hear synths! And bass! And drums! This sounds danceable. Did The Weeknd accidentally play a demo for the disco instead of a sad ballad?\r\n\r\nTurns out \"Blinding Lights\" actually fuses his trademark dark R&B vibes with infectious electro-pop. The result is a track that makes you bust moves like you're at a rave, yet contemplate your unhappy relationships.\r\n\r\n\"I've been on my own for long enough...\" he sings as we awkwardly try to keep up with the beat and not trample people in our excitement. The Weeknd somehow gets us to feel cool and depressive at the same time.\r\n\r\nSo if you feel like dancing your broken heart out, \"Blinding Lights\" is the perfect tune. Enjoy the infectious rhythm and wallow in the melodramatic heartache. The Weeknd takes you on a journey from euphoria to melancholy.\r\n\r\nHe makes angst you can two-step to! This song will have you waving your lighter to and fro as you sway under the mirrorball. It's music for when you're feeling blue on the dancefloor.\r\n\r\n\"Blinding Lights\" is the ideal track when you want to nostalgically weep about your ex but also have a kickin' good time. Let The Weeknd guide you through feeling everything from Saturday Night Fever to Sunday Night Blues.",
