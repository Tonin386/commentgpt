As time marches on, you learn more and you think back upon old instances with new insights. It\u2019s an imperfect methodology, memory is not exact\u2026 and the levels of circumstance are\nMore than you could have even known then and certainly not upon reflection.  \n\nBut, what it also does\u2026 it creates a better awareness of working better.  We are at a place in human history where youth and older generations need to find places of interaction of work within and beyond the various spheres of influence we exist within and are moving toward.  \n\nThis may seem small but it\u2019s not.  The work of health interoperability and infrastructure\u2026 it\u2019s more than that, but it\u2019s also true it\u2019s not.  \n\nWhen hurricane funds have a hard time finding application or policies and the webs of regulations make school updated more challenging\u2026 something\u2019s amiss. But, it\u2019s not government that\u2019s the issue\u2026 it not the regulation, it\u2019s the process of change management in very complex circumstance.   \n\nThe space to work can help, but it\u2019s not a panacea.  And, we need to be thankful it\u2019s not that simple\u2026 hate moves quickly.  \n\nSo many things y\u2019all.",

When many of you supported and voted for Obama, you never held him accountable for doing all the same things you hated GW Bush for.  Same now, many younger people hated Trump, but now you're either sielent about Biden or you support him and he's getting us closer to a nuclear war than ever.  I'm calling all partisan old and young people out, you're all a part of the problem.  The right nor the left are going to save us, only walking away from political parties and ideologies and being truly honest, truly independent truth seekers and critical thinkers and standing for truth will save us.  Screw your evil political parties and ideologies.  \"Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result is insanity.\"  That's the truth.  So if you want something better and new and if you want good, long lasting change, walk away from all the things we've been doing that keep us divided, immoral, stuck, dishonest and all the things making us corrupted ourselves.",

        "text": "I came across this song quite by chance today, but I am a regular poster on the subject of divinity and inspiration in popular songs. This one mostly lacks those elements, I am sad to say (it is no \"The Way it is\" by Bruce Hornsby, which definitely has a touch of the Holy Spirit in it). Nevertheless, this song is pleasant enough and has meaningful content - especially as regards pointless wars of the past (as opposed to the present one with all its good-evil finality and clarity) and as regards the refusal of the mainstream media to address certain issues (whichever side they may pretend to be on). However, the endless repetition of \"waiting\" - the main point of it, after all - is wearing in the extreme in its passivity and conviction as to lack of agency. \n\nAnd given that Mayer's \"generation\" is people born in 1977, while the song is from 2006, the idea that he might still be waiting is scary indeed.\n\nLet us DO SOMETHING! \n\nAnd, whether it is the War or other injustices, one thing we can do at ANY MOMENT - without any hesitation and waiting at all - is get down on our knees and pray to Father, Son and Paraclete. They are indeed WAITING ... for us. For a start, this is PRECISELY what we should do in regard to the War in Ukraine, as that is a clear good-and-evil situation, which is not going to be solved (at least not solved properly) by politics. \n\nIn addressing key content of John Mayer's song, we can note that God does NOT misunderstand people, does not play down their importance or trivialise their contribution, even as - through the Holy Spirit and our own searching for our purpose in life, God offers us chances to act, to change things, to heal things - in each case in the direction of connectivity, unity, meaning, truth and love. \n\nThat is not a little, but a very great deal indeed.",
