She is well respected amongst her music peers, you can tell by all her collabs. She cares of others, remember One Love Manchester, Aretha Franklin tribute, mental illness charity, etc.\n\nIn the end I love her music and I respect her as an artist despite her flaws.",

I love you so so much and just want you to fully enjoy your routine and get the maximum results (skin enthusiast here)!! \nThat's for starters, but other than that\nOMG how beautiful she looks! I hope she knows that she has no reason for hiding anything and we fans are so grateful for her honesty and transparency. We've basically all been waiting for the longest time for this video and it's been so exciting to watch. Can't wait to try at least some of the products, but most importantly \u2013 I have never heard a celebrity make a literal 10-minutes diary out of a vogue secrets video.
