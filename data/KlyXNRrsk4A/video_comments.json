This is what the Bible says about it.. \r\n\"The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil. They will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\" Matt 13: 41-42\r\nJesus Christ is the only way to heaven \"I am the way, the truth, and the life no one comes to the father but by me.\"  John 14:6   Ask God to reveal this to you- He will! \r\n\"For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.\" Romans 3:23 ADMIT THAT YOU'RE A SINNER. We've all broken God's laws and ten commandments.. \"Thou shalt not lie, steal, covet, dishonor parents, take God's name in vain..\"(Exodus 20) We do not have righteousness on our own to get to heaven, \"God made him (Jesus) who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.\" 2 Cor. 5:21 Godly sorrow leads to genuine repentance for sinning against the righteous God and there is a change of heart, we change our mind and God changes our hearts and regenerates us from the inside out. God is deadly serious about sin, when we genuinely repent we hate sin just as God hates it, and we turn away from it.\r\n\"But God commended His love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us.\" Romans 5:8 BELIEVE IN YOUR HEART THAT JESUS CHRIST DIED FOR YOUR SINS, WAS BURIED, AND THAT GOD RAISED JESUS FROM THE DEAD. This is trusting with all of your heart that Jesus Christ is who he said he was. He saves us from sin and hell and brings us into a relationship with him. We become God's children. We are saved from hell, eternal death.\r\n\"For whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.\" Romans 10:13 CALL UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD. Every single person who ever lived since Adam will bend their knee and confess with their mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, the Lord of Lords and the King of Kings.\r\nRead the Bible, Walk with the Lord and give your life to Him!",

        "text": "Nayeon. I have been a K-Pop fan for almost an entire decade and I surprisingly didn\u2019t even know about Twice until three years ago. I didn\u2019t know the group even existed despite being a fan of K-Pop, and despite the fact that Twice is a very well-known and recognized group globally. If my neighbor hadn\u2019t shown me the music video for \u2018Fancy\u2019 one day, I might still not know about the group until this day. I didn\u2019t support Twice right away because I knew nothing about the group, but all I did know is that I liked you from the moment I first saw the music video. Something about your smooth voice, other-worldly visuals, and captivating gaze had me mesmerized by you at the first glance. Since that was the first and only video I had seen of Twice at that time, you were the only aspect of the video that I could remember, but you stuck with me. Your presence lingered in my head and I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how awe-struck I was at the first sight of you. Some months later, I decided to return to the video, and after I realized how much I loved it, it\u2019s been history ever since. Now, I am a dedicated Once, and have learned so much about the group and the music that I can\u2019t believe I wasn\u2019t a Once before. During the year that I took to know you, I realized that you stood out to me for a reason. Going through Twice\u2019s discography, I have been able to understand why you caught my eye before anyone else all those years ago. I love all of the members, but your presence was unlike, and is unlike anything that I\u2019ve ever seen before. I\u2019ve never heard such a shimmering, stunning, and enticing voice like yours before. I have never seen such powerful, energetic, and expressionistic  dancing before I saw you. I have never seen such dedication and appreciation to be on stage, dancing and singing with you beloved members before you. You are just so beautiful, I can\u2019t help but watch you fly across the stage with such hard work and effort evident behind your performance. I have spent every moment since I first discovered you getting to know you and experience what you\u2019ve done during your long time as idol. I know you have gone through so much, and words don\u2019t even come close to identifying the fear and worry you might have sometimes felt during your darkest times. I wish I was a Once at that time to be able to help you through them, but I know you had your members and millions of other loving Once to help you through it. Just know I couldn\u2019t be more proud to support someone who is so strong and hasn\u2019t given up. During some of your hardest times, you haven\u2019t lost the goofiness that I know your are notorious for, and that I know your members and Once love about you. While getting acquainted to your personality, I realize I have been laughing harder than I have in a long time. I\u2019ve have loved becoming familiar with your spontaneous jokes and you teasing your members. I know they and Once love you so much because you always make us laugh and put a smile on our faces with your natural sense of humor that is so unique to you. I love everything about you and I resonate with you on more than one level. I am so blessed that you came into my life because I have loved every second since you\u2019ve done so. I know that your members and Once are lucky to have somebody who is such a rare gem and is all-around talented at everything that she does. You are so loved More and More (pun intended) each passing second by everyone who knows you and I just want you to be aware of your self-worth, especially when you are feeling down. Just know how many people there are who will always love and support you no matter what happens. I am so happy that I became a Once, and even though I wasn\u2019t there sooner, I have more love for you and the rest of Twice that I can even describe. Thank you so much for coming into my life, making me so happy, and inspiring me and so many people all around the world for the better. You are such a ray of sunshine and we are so blessed to have you in our lives! On behalf of your friends, members, Once and family who are the most proud of you, love you the most, and who we thank for raising such a smart and admirable woman, I wish you the most fun, decorative, and perfect birthday that you could possibly have! Please enjoy your birthday because you deserve it and I hope you find happiness in everything that you do! I pray that you and your loved ones stay safe, and find happiness and worth in the future. Please stay safe, and happy birthday Nayeon! We love and adore you so much. You mean the world to me and always will!",
