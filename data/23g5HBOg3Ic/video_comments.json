So there I was last night sitting in my barracks having a pretty shit week, playing Pokemon and finished the game. When I tell you hearing this song, from an artist I loved as a child, in a game franchise I loved as a child, brought a tear to my eye and healed my soul a bit.\n\nMr. Sheeran I know you may not ever see this, but thank you for everything you do. You have revived a piece of myself I didnt know was missing.",

        "text": "Una storia d'amore struggente che germoglia in un paese sugli Appennini toscani fra i noccioli in fiore e le torbide ombre di una montagna infestata da una feroce belva, un uomo sadico che uccide solo vecchi dagli ottantacinque anni in su. Li mutila, evirando loro i genitali. \nDario \u00e8 un medico di Pronto Soccorso in villeggiatura a casa della nonna che vive da sempre su quella montagna che per lui non ha segreti. \nRoda \u00e8 la giovane nipote di due aguzzini che non si arrende a un'esistenza fatta solo di brutalit\u00e0 e duro lavoro nei campi. Ed \u00e8 in lei che inizier\u00e0 il tormento del dubbio, capace di scalfire l'immagine idealizzata del ragazzo salvatore e aggiunger\u00e0 intensit\u00e0 al loro rapporto che si rincorre sul filo sempre pi\u00f9 teso fra eros e thanatos, in un intreccio di vite che far\u00e0 credere a una sola possibile verit\u00e0. \nAlla fine, anche Dario sceglier\u00e0 la verit\u00e0 dei sentimenti, riuscendo a liberarsi dalla prigione delle convenzioni e delle aspettative altrui, fino all'ultimo assassinio e colpo di scena. \nConsiderate come morti senza un perch\u00e9, il pluriomicida verr\u00e0 smascherato da un piccolo ragno.",

I'm also impressed with how Pokemon has evolved throughout my life. This year I turn 30 and my first game was Gold & Silver on a Gameboy Color in the Pikachu edition. I stopped playing after Gen4 and found my way back in Gen6. My memories in Pokemon will never erased if I listen to this art of a track!",
