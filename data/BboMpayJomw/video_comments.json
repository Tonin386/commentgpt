Much like real life at the time, and as bond builds more throughout the film as well... Perfect song for a perfect film",

        "text": "Hello there! To the one reading this, a blessed day. I just want to share the good news of salvation.\n\nEven if You feel that You are alone and no one cares for you, Someone cares and loves You unconditionally. His name is the LORD GOD who created you and me\u2014who knows everything about us, every pain, every failure, every struggle and every hurt in us. He is there and He wants to be a Father to you. However, the reality is GOD is perfect and He is holy but we are sinners for we sinned against Him and against others. As GOD is a God of justice, He is against sin and so we cannot save ourselves by our own power because of our fallen nature. Nevertheless, as GOD loves us so much and desires to reconcile us to Himself, He descended from Heaven and took the form of man. He is the Lord JESUS who lived His life without sin because He himself is GOD. Him being the perfect sacrificial lamb, He was crucified to take on the punishment that was meant for us sinners. He died for You and me. But death cannot hold the Lord JESUS because He doesn't deserve death for He did not sin and so now reigns in heaven. By accepting the Lord JESUS as your personal Lord and Savior, you receive His sacrifice and so your sins will be forgiven by the LORD. The Lord JESUS loves you and if You come to Him regardless of Your past, He can renew you. He is able to wash our sins clean by His precious blood. You can come to Him. \n\nFor GOD so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life.\nJohn 3:16",

I\u2019ve heard them all starting with Goldfinger, that was the first song at the beginning of the film. Dr No was the film before Goldfinger but the song was at the end of the film. John Berry wrote the original Bond theme song in only one night! In fact his best friend, Actor Michael Caine was sleeping at his house for two weeks because he\u2019d been kicked out of his last flat for too many female guests. Caine said he went to bed and an hour later he was woken up by John composing on the piano! He said great I\u2019m not gonna get any sleep for two weeks now! That next morning at breakfast Michael asked John what was he composing and he said it was the new bond theme song and he\u2019d finished and played it for Michael, so Michael Caine was the first person to ever hear the bond theme song!",

        "text": "Trust in Jesus, Hell is real and eternal! This is what the Bible says about it.. \r\n\"The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil. They will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\" Matt 13: 41-42\r\nJesus Christ is the only way to heaven \"I am the way, the truth, and the life no one comes to the father but by me.\"  John 14:6   Ask God to reveal this to you- He will! \r\n\"For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.\" Rom 3:23 ADMIT THAT YOU'RE A SINNER. We've all broken God's laws and ten commandments.. \"Thou shalt not lie, steal, covet, dishonor parents, take God's name in vain..\"(Exodus 20) We do not have righteousness on our own to get to heaven, \"God made him (Jesus) who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.\" 2 Cor. 5:21 Godly sorrow leads to genuine repentance for sinning against the righteous God and there is a change of heart, we change our mind and God changes our hearts and regenerates us from the inside out.\r\n\"But God commended His love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us.\" Romans 5:8 BELIEVE IN YOUR HEART THAT JESUS CHRIST DIED FOR YOUR SINS, WAS BURIED, AND THAT GOD RAISED JESUS FROM THE DEAD. This is trusting with all of your heart that Jesus Christ is who he said he was. He saves us from sin and hell and brings us into a relationship with him. We become God's children. We are saved from hell, eternal death.\r\n\"For whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.\" Romans 10:13 CALL UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD. Every single person who ever lived since Adam will bend their knee and confess with their mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, the Lord of Lords and the King of Kings.\r\nRead the Bible, Walk with the Lord and give your life to Him!",

I have literally listened to every track of No Time To Die on Spotify, but I can't find it. Am I overlooking it? I would love to have that track in my music list while Skating. So if anyone could help me out haha, that would be great.\nThis is a great song too btw! Love her voice, the orchestra and the anticipation building up.",

All my life imitated him by putting on suits because I look handsome in them. Betrayed, forgotten and abandoned by those who I loved once so much. Red color is my second favorite color and roses are my second favorite flowers. I am very passionate when I love someone. I have serious trust issues with people because where I liver people lie, deceit and cheat and are simply double faced hypocrites. \n\nI suffer from extreme paranoia and whenever I see some one, I think that he is looking at me for some reason noticing and observing my behavior.\n\nWhen I was in school, I took a test: How would I die and I got the answer that I will be murdered. Ever since that time, I have been looking over my shoulders like 007.\n\nFor M: I would like to say that she was 100% right of course when she quoted couplets from Tennyson. We are not now the strength which in old days moved Earth and heavens because we have lost faith in the cause of Humanity. My religion is Humanity. God can question somebody else for a change.\n\nP.S: May Mother's Soul Rest In Peace. Amen!!!\n\nBest Regards\nJ.S.",

I actually like the music video better than the song in the movie because they did a good job of choosing movie clips for the video.  I also really liked Adam Lambert's version of Mad World he too sang it really hauntingly. So many songs these days have no substance its refreshing to hear songs that tell a good story or have alot of emotion.",

Am fan not because of ur fame or status.its  Because of the vibe you  put in ur music. The kind that's peacefull to listen to after a day of trying to find meaning goin to the gym to calm the fury and putting on a fake smile to those I socialize with, and intimate with. and calming the storm that is the damn mind.
