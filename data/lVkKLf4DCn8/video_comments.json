Even for us swifties because we grew up listening to those songs, and it feels so personal. Here's to only streaming Taylor's Version but never forgetting the memories and emotions we associate with the stolen version because that's what made it all possible \ud83c\udf7b",

        "text": "So the story here is her album speak now (amongst other albums) was stolen. This song remained unreleased but since they sold the masters it had to be re-recorded. All those dresses there was what she wore in all her stolen albums and concerts. There were several complecations which prevented Taylor from re recording. Taylor was literally helpless but with the help of her allies who fought for her, she overcome complecations and re recorded her albums. But looking back she saw her past albums, years of her hardwork getting destroyed. But she had to move forward. Taking the new speak now poster with her showed that she is re recording speak now album and we all know it was mostly dedicated to Lautner. Meanwhile Joey and Presley were there in her \"Mean\" video as two victims of bullying so in this story they are fighting back. The narrative has changed. Also purple is the primary colour of Speak Now.",
