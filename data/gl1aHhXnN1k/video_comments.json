I remember I had just gotten home from school and was counting down the minutes until its release, I saw the clip from start to finish with a big smile on my face, and I was sure that the clip would be a huge success, AND IT WAS.

It's probably the weirdest relationship. She reminds me of golum from the Lord of the rings, she looks at you like her precious haha. Yo you have something she don't got it's an amazing personality and vocals plus your hot, she is the complete opposite. You are a CELEBRITY for a reason people like YOU. That toxic b**** is just leeching off of you to feel kinda cool because people don't like her since young. Don't give her no thought, no time, no nothing. Tell em follow.",

Christian was meeting up with you on the set of Victorious and you guys would get together in your dressing room. \n\nWhile he was an Actor for Victorious featured in the Tmz episode, an episode called Robarazzi!! He was dating Rikki Valentina at the time, the same girl that tried to give you the benefit of the doubt, thinking you didn\u2019t know they were dating so she messages you through Facebook and you block her. The truth always comes out. Rikki Valentina is now happily married with a man that loves her so so much, I\u2019m so SO sorry you and Dalton didn\u2019t work out. I wanted you to have that happy ending but babes IF YOU COULD TAKE SOMEONES MANS THAT EASILY, THAT MAN AIN\u2019T WORTH KEEPING\ud83d\udcaf \n\nRemember that\ud83d\ude18 I love you, i hope you did read this\u2764",
