        "text": "Haha \ud83d\ude05 I seriously lmao, always women\u2019s songs about a broken relationship or because a betrayal like this case and the funniest is all those song by women is always accepted and liked. I really want to hear a song like this but this time sung by a man and know what would be the reaction of people. Oh right, he will be a sexist, misogynist and little man for expressing his own empowerment or the betrayal of a woman. The typical shit of the ridiculous feminism \ud83e\udd23 full of misandry and full of lies",

I always tried to forget the pain I felt from my grandmothers passing but realized you havd to cry and let things go in order to move forward. I felt like half of me was missing and listening to this song made me feel liberated! Specifically the line \"This is the part of me that you're never ever gonna take from me\" aint no one ever gonna take the part of my me that I lost Eleven years ago again I know she wouldnt want me to stop speaking spanish and forget about her so Im not going to and Spanish is something thats a priority not an option.\nI miss you grandma I cant wait to see you again. Youll be the first person I hug when I get to heaven!",

        "text": "Love this song but the boy should be the one who's actually singing it because the girl is the one being abusive.\n\n1.( nothing he said implies cheating making her look like she saying he can't have female friends which is abusive\n2.) She bugs him without his knowledge or consent showing a clear lack of care for his privacy which is abusive.\n\nWe both know if this song was sung by a man and started like this as the man treating the woman like that no one would be supporting this kind of conducting would actually call it pro abuse propaganda.\nBasically the girl is in abusive POS and the boy will be better off without her",
