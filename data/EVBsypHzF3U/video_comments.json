The stylized opening credits, the use of amplified stock sound effects, the hyperreal pop art colors and old school Hollywood vibe, the close ups of props that look reminiscent of iconic fifties American brands, the whiplash editing, the retro screen wipes, the Brian De Palma split screen shots, the pop up animations and subtitles, the Pulp Fiction diner set (it\u2019s nearly identical, right down to the shot angles), the cut to the dog, right down to the Kill Bill highway driving shots in the Pussy Wagon (even the keychain is there)! \n\nGaga spoke to him during production, and he said he\u2019d loan her the truck, and that she just had to use it in the video\u2014it fits the vibe perfectly! If I didn\u2019t know better I would have thought he directed it himself\u2014I bet he got a kick out of the result.",
