As it is written:\n\n\u201cTherefore I will praise you among the Gentiles;\n    I will sing the praises of your name.\u201d[c]\n\n10 Again, it says,\n\n\u201cRejoice, you Gentiles, with his people.\u201d[d]\n\n11 And again,\n\n\u201cPraise the Lord, all you Gentiles;\n    let all the peoples extol him.\u201d[e]\n\n12 And again, Isaiah says,\n\n\u201cThe Root of Jesse will spring up,\n    one who will arise to rule over the nations;\n    in him the Gentiles will hope.\u201d[f]\n\n13 May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.",
