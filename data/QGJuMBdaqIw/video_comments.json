I can't describe how much memory this song holds and how much i love my sister. Every time i listen to this it fills me up with hope. Us, humans all have different stories and different hopes and dreams. We are like the infinite number of stars in the universe. Trough the history, many people and many dreams came and left. In this life the important thing is to know that we all worth something and we all have to love and respect eachother. As a child i wasn't aware of the brutal truth about reality  and always thought that the world and people as a whole were always happy and celebrating. This song gives me a lot of nostalgia of the times where i was innocent and loving. Now i grown up to be one of the people who hates everything and don't even want to live. But still, the child inside of me still wants and hopes that one day every war and problems will vanish and we will allways celebrate and have fun like life is a festival and i'll always gonna wait for the day that everyone is a whole. I want to visit different countries and know different people with their own unique story and be friend with them. I want to live a life that is full of adventures and memories that ill remember after i die. Thank you for this amazing song Katy Perry <3s",

Will they embrace the defense or run from it? Coach Amy McGowan the ACC Legend knows about winning championships at every level. She has the talent but will they come together or rest on their laurels. The coaching staff can coach them up and get them ready but it is up to them. The fans want it but do the coaches and players? Stay tuned Class AAA, there are plenty of challengers one in Murfreesboro told me her goal was to win the region in 2023. I know why this coach doesn't want to go to Blue Raider Arena because that is where dreams go to die.",
