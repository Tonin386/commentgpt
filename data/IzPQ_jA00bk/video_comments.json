        "text": "I discovered this music last month when I was doing my summer job somewhere else and the job was very physically tiring that my back would hurt most of the time and I was alone cause it was a new place I didn't know anyone. But listening to this everyday while and after working gave me the energy to persevere and also somehow comforted me. Now that my summer job ended, autumn semester in college just started and I just moved back to the dorm, this song feels weird in a good way. Cause it kinda feels like a great memory and it's attached to the environment in my summer job. It just shows how powerful a song can be. Thank you, Austin. (also include Overdrive and Mourning)",
