Oh, to be a brooding pop star pondering life's troubles! We mere mortals can't possibly grasp this level of histrionic soul-searching. Excuse us while we swoon under a stormy sky to this earnest anthem for existential crises. But cynicism aside, Harry bares his heart with defiant vulnerability here. I mean, he's no Dylan but props for baring your soul, Hazza. Now back to belting passionately about feelings while striking tortured poses in your flowy pirate shirts. Work that slow-mo hair flip!",

I am a sense for sadness in this Universe. In ancient times, someone banished onto earth all things sad from all worlds and moulded my heart from them. And ever since, I\u2019ve been the sense for sadness. I live by sucking sadness from all beings and creatures. Every creature, as soon as I draw near it, drops a black drop of sadness each into my heart. And the black dew of sadness starts streaming through my veins in a fine rill. And there, in my heart, the black dew of sadness turns pallid and bluish. \r\n\r\nThis sadness is imbued, as a magnetic power, throughout my entire being. And it irresistibly attracts all sad things of this world, hoarding them within my heart. This is why I am the saddest of all creatures. Don\u2019t laugh at me you, who are laughing! I\u2019m astounded to realize that in this world full of sorrow there is a creature laughing. O, accursed and thrice accursed gift: to laugh in a world, pent-up in sadness, seething with pain \u2014 a world rampaged by death! O, gift of doomed creatures! Because of my sadness I never laugh. And how could I laugh, when you who laugh are so rough and savage! When you are so wicked, so ugly! Your wickedness has made you ugly. For only evil despoils of beauty all the earthly and celestial creatures\u2026 I remember, yes, I recall \u2013 there was a time when this earth used to be paradise, and I \u2014 a doe of paradise. O, memories that enrapture and transport me from joy to joy, from immortality to immortality, from eternity to eternity!... \r\n\r\nI am standing at the side of a brook, whose banks are adorned with blue flowers. And the brook is my tears streaming. Men wounded me in the heart and instead of blood tears gushed out from it. O, gentle heavens, look! \u2013 to you I\u2019m confessing my secret: in my heart I carry tears instead of blood. This is my life, this is my secret. This is why I weep for all who are in sorrow, for all innocent, for all humiliated, for all offended, for all hungry, for all orphaned (and forlorn), for all who are hurt, for all who are anguished, for all who mourn. My thoughts choke on sadness and turn into feelings, and my feelings pour out in tears. Yes, my feelings are countless, and my tears \u2013 out of number. And any feeling of mine is each ready to grieve and wail, for as soon as it gets out of me into the world around, it invariably comes across some human rudeness. O, is there a being ruder and severer than man?... \r\n\r\nWhy have I been thrown into this world, among humans? O, sometimes, very long ago, when I sojourned in the thick and endless forests, I knew not man and to me the world was joy and heaven. And I was delightfully weaving my heavenly moods and raptures amidst sweet-scented flowers and graceful birch-trees, in quiet forests and under azure skies. But then in my paradise came he: harsh, cruel and arrogant \u2014 the man. And he crushed underfoot my flowers, he cut down the trees, and he darkened the sky. And so, he turned my paradise into hell... O, I do not hate him for that, but I pity him. I pity him for having no feeling of paradise. And for a being there can be no greater horror than this, for any being at all. Know well that a doe cannot hate, she can only feel pity and compassion. Sadness \u2013 this is her revenge. Sadness intermingled with compassion\u2026 O, men, how harsh and rude you are! I have heard that there are demons. Can those be worse than men? Only one thing I beg for, only one wish I have: not to be a soul in man, a feeling in man, a thought in man\u2026 \r\n\r\nEach human rudeness I experience as a heavy blow on my heart. And these have wounded my heart. O, how numerous bruises I have in my heart! How many blows!... Ah, yes! Well, I am in paradise lost: a doe in paradise lost! Have mercy on me, O, All-Good and All-Gentle One! Lots of bruises, one next to the other, one over another, and thus \u2013 a wound has opened up inside my heart! Oh, save me from men, from those rude and evil men! Thus Thou shall transform my world into paradise and my sorrow \u2013 into joy\u2026 \r\n\n/.../\r\n\r\nIn times of yore \u2014 the white does related \u2014 He walked the earth: the All-Good and All-Merciful One, and He turned the earth into heaven. Where He stood, there it was paradise. Shedding upon each being and upon each creation from Him were endless kindness, and love, and tenderness, and grace, and sweetness, and wisdom. He walked the earth, and He brought heaven down to earth. They called Him Jesus. O, in Him we have seen that man can be wonderful and beautiful, only when one is sinless. He both grieved with our sorrow, and He wept with us because of the evil inflicted on us by men. He was with us, but He was against the human creations: that is, sin, evil and death. He loved every creature gently and compassionately; He caressed them with some Divine grief and guarded them against human sin, against human evil, and against human death. He was and has forever remained our God \u2014 God of the grieving and embittered creatures, from the smallest ones to the biggest. \r\n\r\nOnly those people who resemble Him \u2014 they alone are dear to us. They are our kin, our immortality, and our love. The soul of such people is woven from His goodness, compassion, love, tenderness, sweetness, righteousness, and wisdom. Their intelligence is divinely wise, divinely good, divinely meek, and divinely compassionate. And they are like bright and holy angels. For great intelligence and great kindness \u2013 welded in one \u2013 this is what makes the angel.\r\n\r\nTherefore, all our love is pining for Jesus the all-good, the all-kind, the all-merciful, the all-tender. He is our God, our Immortality, and our Eternity. His Gospel is ours rather than men\u2019s, for the simple fact that inside of us there is more of His goodness, His love, His tenderness... He, O! He \u2013 is blessed in all our hearts and in all our worlds! He is our Lord and our God! He is our sweet consolation in this bitter, transient world, and our eternal joy of that immortal world which is coming\u2026",

This awful event it really broke me for a while and I couldn't stop crying for such a long time. On a really random day,   I was driving my car on my way to work, and I would every day pass in front of the cemitery every morning... Right in that particular moment I first heard this song on the radio,  somehow it was almost as if she reached me  that moment. I don't know what's magical with this song, but it really helped me accepting her absence a little bit better, as if released me from my pain. Thank you for that!",

I gave it my all bruises all over my body from hitting myself with the flag. One of the girls asked how I felt about it and I gave her an a mello smile, then I had to go to my musical rehearsal (which was Grease) and I found out I didn\u2019t make it a second time right before running summer nights one more time. I balled my eyes out and I couldn\u2019t help but cry during one of the happiest parts of the musical. I told my classmate congratulations for making it and ran out to go home before more people saw me crying. Now every time I hear this song I just imagine it all in my head and it hurts even more every time",

Paladin started talking to a prospector; that is when I heard it. The prospector said, 'It feels like it has been 700 years since I last spoke to another soul.' I was so moved by that, I wrote this poem. Thank you for taking the time and reading my work. I hope you enjoyed it.\"",
